Text normalization is also often called text cleansing or wrangling.\n","\n","Below are various techniques used in the process of text normalization:\n","\n","    Cleaning Text\n","    Removing punctuation\n","    Removing html tags\n","    Removing Special Characters\n","    Removing Emails\n","    Case Conversions\n","    Removing Stopwords\n","    Removing Extra Spaces\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8,"status":"ok","timestamp":1665848727586,"user":{"displayName":"vinay G","userId":"05418370089911733853"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"cePApUy-uILX"},"outputs":[],"source":["def cleaning(text):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Return clean version of the text\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # Remove all non-letters and non-spaces except for hyphens and digits\n","    text = text.apply(lambda x: re.sub(r\"[^0-9A-Za-z\\- ]+\", \" \", str(x)))\n","    # Remove all numbers except those attached to a word\n","    text = text.apply(lambda x: re.sub(\"(?<!\\w)\\d+\", \"\", x))\n","    # Remove all hyphens except between two words\n","    text = text.apply(lambda x: re.sub(\"-(?!\\w)|(?<!\\w)-\", \"\", x))\n","    #Remove html tags\n","    text = text.apply(lambda x: BeautifulSoup(x, 'lxml').get_text())\n","    # Remove multiple spaces and lowercase everything\n","    text = text.apply(lambda x: \" \".join(x.split()))\n","    text = text.apply(lambda x: x.lower())\n","    #Removing stop words\n","    text = text.apply(lambda x: \" \".join([i for i in x.split() if i not in STOP_WORDS]) ) \n","\n","    return text"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":710},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":65886,"status":"ok","timestamp":1665848793465,"user":{"displayName":"vinay G","userId":"05418370089911733853"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"iJ-8QQGRDnsw","outputId":"f229219b-48cc-400a-f3c4-497112a7819d"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["            reviewerID        asin      reviewerName helpful  Rating  \\\n","0       A1VXOAVRGKGEAK  0439893577             Angie  [0, 0]       5   \n","1        A8R62G708TSCM  0439893577           Candace  [1, 1]       4   \n","2       A21KH420DK0ICA  0439893577    capemaychristy  [1, 1]       5   \n","3        AR29QK6HPFYZ4  0439893577              dcrm  [0, 0]       5   \n","4        ACCH8EOML6FN5  0439893577              DoyZ  [1, 1]       4   \n","...                ...         ...               ...     ...     ...   \n","167592  A18Q24BZK2CB5P  B00LBI9BKA  nicole todhunter  [0, 0]       5   \n","167593  A1I8ON1X0B2N2W  B00LBI9BKA                PF  [1, 1]       5   \n","167594  A3V24H5350ULKI  B00LBI9BKA       Sara Tafuri  [0, 0]       5   \n","167595  A1W2F1WI0QZ4AJ  B00LBI9BKA    Tabitha Nicole  [0, 0]       5   \n","167596   AV6WVMUJVUHNB  B00LBI9BKA          ToyLover  [0, 0]       4   \n","\n","        unixReviewTime reviewTime  \\\n","0           1390953600 2014-01-29   \n","1           1395964800 2014-03-28   \n","2           1359331200 2013-01-28   \n","3           1391817600 2014-02-08   \n","4           1399248000 2014-05-05   \n","...                ...        ...   \n","167592      1404691200 2014-07-07   \n","167593      1404691200 2014-07-07   \n","167594      1404777600 2014-07-08   \n","167595      1405641600 2014-07-18   \n","167596      1405382400 2014-07-15   \n","\n","                                                   review  \\\n","0       I like the item pricing.

actually considering buying a second set. These are super cool looking, well crafted, and sturdy enough to bookend some very thick manuals, lol. I started using them for my cookbooks but then realized the folly of not using them for my video games, and so I rectified that situation, lol. Anyway, if you're looking at these, then you already have played Portal 2 or know somebody who has. You wont be disappointed. In a sense, with regards to these bookends, the cake is NOT a lie. :)Super cool\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  My Grandson's both wanted this for Christmas.

He loves the camera/video feature and it has been in constant use while on vacation.  The unit itself is easy for him to manipulate, both technically and physically, and the only complaint we have is more a concern about the sturdiness of it.  Let's just say it isn't exactly kid proof and while asking for it to be waterproof and scratch-proof is unrealistic the design of this makes it more suitable for sitting and playing indoors then the rough-and-tumble life of a six year old boy.  Overall, we have had fun with this and will be looking into exploring the other, downloadable options soon.fun times with the camera, easy for small hands to use\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  While on vacation my kids' got hooked on the Would You Rather Questions that we found.  So we got the card game for home to play as a family.  It's fun to play with the whole family!Fun!\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  This is the kind of toy I'd wish I'd gotten a smoking deal on.  It's not the worst game we have in the closet, but it wasn't worth the $25 we paid for it.For starters, the butterflies do not fly very well once outside of the elephants trunk.  The fan doesn't blow very well, so there isn't much extra help to get those butterflies going, either.  The butterflies just come out of the trunk and drop.  So the kids just stand there - not like on the tv commercial...Also, depending on the age of your children, they're either going to be too good or not ready for the game.  I have 4 kids plus their friends.  And we've found that there isn't a lot of middle ground.  Either they're great at this, or they have a lot to learn about catching butterflies...  So having the good kids and the bad kids play together causes problems.  Beware of this.Anyway - if you read this review before buying, only buy this game if it's a super good deal (or your child is dying to have it)  It's not worth the full price.Nice idea, poor execution.\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  I get the feeling that they purposefully make some of the things in these software lame in an attempt to motivate people to buy others. There is a lot here and if all the functions were fun, you wouldn't need a lot more of these for a preschooler. The games are fairly lame but they do make a stab at being educational. The story is better than the completely idiotic monkey story that comes with the original system and the drawing program has some cool things added.Much better than monkey software but could be improved if they wanted to\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  I got the Fisher Price Bucky Pirate Ship when it first came out, and have been relatively happy with it.  It's help up well and is lot's of fun with the sound effects and the shooting water cannons.  So I was excited to get Hook's Jolly Roger ship so that my little ones can play act one of their favorite shows on Disney.I think it is very well made.  We found the trap door, slide out walk the plank and shooting water cannons to be lots of fun.  Just like on Bucky there are wheels on the bottom of the ship so when your little one scoots it on the floor it has a rolling motion like it was sailing at sea.  I love that :)One of the things that I wish it had was the sound effects that you get with Bucky, but considering it's half the price I can understand why it doesn't.  One advantage to that though is that this toy doesn't need any batteries, just imagination!Be warned ahead of time that the Jolly Roger is quite a bit smaller than Bucky.Finally the other thing that I don't like about not only this toy, but with many of Fisher Price toys as of late is that they want you to buy additional pieces in order to get all of the characters.  For instance with Bucky, it only comes with Jake and the parrot, but you have to buy supplemental pieces to get Izzy & Cubby.  I extremely dislike this tactic to almost force you to buy more.  The Bucky set should have come with Jake, Izzy, Cubby & the Parrot.  The Jolly Roger set should have come with Hook, Smee, & the other pirate.Overall though if your child loves Jake and the Neverland Pirates, then I think you will be extremely happy with not only the Jolly Roger, but alsoFisher-Price Disney's Jake and The Never Land Pirates - Jake's Musical Pirate Ship Bucky.  You can't really have one without the other :)  While you are at it I would also recommend buying theDisney Store Disney Jr. Jake and the Never Land/Neverland Pirates 7 Piece Action Figure Figurine Gift Play Set.Jolly Roger is just OK, but a Nice Companion Toy to Bucky\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  MY granddaughter is 2 years old and loves to build things with regular blocks,she loves the lego blocks.she can build higher , which she loves.

Since then I've also played the actual board game and I can't say enough good things about this game. Pretty simple rules to get started, and once you do the fun never stops. Even in games I've gotten clobbered, I still have a great time, and my girlfriend loves it too. This is one that you can play with your whole family and easily teach any guests you have to play. There are a lot of little train pieces that could get lost in a party but other than that minor concern, I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this wonderfully original, beautifully presented game. All the praise is deserved.Addictive\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  THIS FIGURE IS AMAZING! By far the greatest Goku figure out there!

I have a group of very close , long time friends ( going back as far as 30 years ) so we can easily revert back to our immature years given the right circumstances .

I know some very conservative and & # 34 ; politically correct & # 34 ; type folks that love to play this game , people I really thought would never play it after reading just a few cards . When the game ' s over , you don ' t feel bad at all for playing it , you just laugh about the combinations you or others put together and you keep reminiscing with them over the game ! - DThe core game and rules box - great stuff !\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: As long as you don ' t get offended by crude words or uncomfortable situations that lead to laughter that will make you cry , this \u001b[32m<game:Positive Confidence:0.9949581027030945>\u001b[0m is for you .

It is not for you . If you ' re into any of the above , however , then you should pick this bad boy up and get a group of your weirdest friends together for some good times . Depending on who you play with , you can use political satire , d * * k jokes , or outrageous racism to have fun and bond with like - minded people ! Excessive alcohol use is highly encouraged , though not necessary , while enjoying this card game . Protip : If you are playing with drunk people , skip the double - answer questions .

It ' s hard to explain just exactly what the game is and what makes it so funny , but I ' ll give it a try . Everyone draws 7 cards which have saying on them like ' Michelle Obama ' s arms ' , then one person draws a question card , such as ' what really turns on President Obama ' ? then each player must lay down one of their cards as an answer . Maybe another player lays down a card that says & # 34 ; ignoring third world countries ' , and you can see how inappropriate the game can become . Another question card might say ' - - - - - - is a trap ' . And you might use lay down your answer card which says ' a zesty breakfast burrito ' or ' estrogen ' , in the hopes that your card will be picked and when someone acquires a certain number of cards , they are declared the winner . To say this game brings out the worse in people is an understatement . Your job is to answer the questions as the playing asking the question would answer , which is why the game becomes such a riot . If the questioner is someone who can hit bottom , you job is to answer the question with a card that will reveal his / her inner prejudices , fears , bad behavior etc . I ' ve played a lot of games and this is truly the most fun we ' ve ever had . I ' ve just explained how to play it , and it ' s that easy . The only thinking involved is in knowing the inner lives of your opponents . This game is a study inside the dark , inner workings of your friends and family , and if you play it on Thanksgiving , it might just make it hard to sleep at night knowing who you share blood relations with . . . hysterically funny , and easy to learn\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: We have to be careful about who is playing this \u001b[31m<game:Negative Confidence:0.9966028928756714>\u001b[0m since it is extremely offensive but it did bring quite a few tears and stomach pain !

If you are easily offended by digs about race , religion , or other sensitive topics , this game is probably not for you . It ' s really for horrible people . The second time I played it was with my family and family friends at Christmas time . One of our family friends who will be the first person to make dick / piss / crap jokes was so uncomfortable playing that he finally said , & # 34 ; that ' s it , I ' m outta here & # 34 ; and left LOL !

A disclaimer - I played it at a party with my 18 year old daughter and not only did I have to explain a lot of things to her , I had to google a couple myself . The game is a real groaner sometimes . You may ask , \" But wait - I can go to the game website and download a free . pdf of the game , right ? Why would I pay for a copy ? \" The answer : 2 reasons . # 1 - to support the developers . # 2 - these a printed on laminate card stock to take a little damage .

I like to think I am a good , wholesome person , but I still love this game . I have played it with a very large group of people during a game night . Everyone was cracking up laughing the whole time , we went through every card in the box , and it was the only game we played that night . There were people crying because they were laughing so hard . Some people actually apologized because of the cards they were playing . That is a good sign that it is a horribly hilarious game .

I decided to take a break from FPS and take a chance on this title. WOW!!! Was I pleasently surprised. Not since Crash Bandicoot have I enjoyed a game of this nature... and lets face it.... this game is Crash Bandicoot with Firearms. Great lighthearted humor.... Great variety in maps.... Great variety in weapons.... Great variety in enemies.... Great Fun!!!! Some people have stated that the game is a little too easy... not so. It is approxamatly 18 hours long (double that if you want all the upgrades to the weapons) and I didnt find myself feeling stupid becuase I didnt know where to go next or how to solve incredibly hard puzzles like such games as the new mario's, blinx, and starfox would have you doing. This game was challenging enough to keep me interested, but not so challenging that I got frustrated. If you like this style game.... but are tired of all the ill fated attempts to make this genra fun again.... be prepared to be very surprised with RATCHET AND CLANK. I highly recommend it to anyone who misses CRASH. Now... Im off to buy the sequel.Cant wait to play the sequel.\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  If you're a fan of HK movies that involves the Triads, then this is a game for you.Yea, I was Andy Lau working my way up the ranks.Thought this was better than other True Crime titles.Reminds me of all those Triad HK movies\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  I bought it because of how cheap it is -- and I don't regret it, really.

At some point I had conquered the world with just about every playable race, so going in expectations were extremely high for the next in the series.  After playing for a week, I want to give this 5 stars, because the game is a lot of fun, but bugs/issue make it impossible.The city management system is very good, it's all about maintaining a balance between your treasury, your armory, peoples happiness, and food production.  For example if you want to build the a training ground that will let you train the most powerful troops, that building will also produce a large amount of squalor that will make your people unhappy (and thus likely to revolt).  Space in the cities is limited, so I found myself constantly tinkering with my cities to maintain the strongest military closest to the front while using my inner cities to supply the food/supplies to fight.The armies while handled different from Rome 1, I've also come to like.  Building provide garrisons (based on type) to protect the city, armies have to have a general in them, and the number of generals is limited by the amount of land you've conquered.  This seemed to make the army management much easier to work with, instead of trying to manage tons of towns and generals, you just seem really need to manage the generals.  Recruitment and replenishment seems much easier as well compared to the prior Rome.  I do miss the dynastic feeling of having all the generals come from you family, but I like how units that are together a long time can gain unit traditions (abilities) separate from the Generals who lead them.The battles are fun but a little frustrating.  Maybe it's because I've only played as Rome so far, but the enemy really seems to break way to easily.  As long as you are using basic tactics such as protecting your artillery and not allowing the enemy to out flank you, you should win most battles unless you are hideously outnumbered.  Calvary really serves no purpose that I've found besides running down enemy archers once the armies are engaged, and in most of the battles I've fought the computer AI seems to never use calvary themselves.  A couple times I tried to wheel my horse in behind enemy lines, but the enemy units would break/flee before they could even get in position. Naval battle I didn't get at all, and after some rather odd outcomes just resorted to auto resolve to complete them.  Still there is something satisfying about a good siege battle, or crushing a massive enemy force in the forests of Europe that kept be playing.Now for the problems, which I would basically sum up in two ways, bugs and AI.First for bugs, the game has a tendency to crash.  Can't say it happens all the time, but I'd say in the 15-20 hours I've played I've seen it happen at least 6-7 times.  Really annoying was in the middle of one battle the game would crash at around the same time continuously (3 times in a row).  Another bug I saw a lot was on the diplomacy screen, sometimes the buttons would all be greyed out, including the option to exit the diplomacy screen.  The only way to resolve it was to basically force the game to close and reload.  I got into the habit of saving before trying diplomacy.  Finally and I don't know if this is a bug or just a performance issue, but the load times and times between turns is excessively long.  I have a year old computer that met or exceeded all the requirements on this game so I don't think that is the issue.  It was not uncommon to wait several minuets between turns, I would suggest turning off the computer movements to help with this.Now the AI, which seems..... questionable.  I understand thatin a game like this where there is a lot going on, occasionally you'll see odd things but finding repeated odd behavior is frustrating.  The AI diplomacy decisions seem completely random, and the treaties they offer you are almost always ridiculous.  Several long time allies would just decide to cancel all treaties with me for no reason I could determine, I wasn't attacking their allies or helping their enemies, they just got bored I guess.  They wouldn't attack, just randomly cancel trade treaties.  Another issue I saw was sieges from sea units, twice I saw a vastly inferior force lay siege to a city, and then basically both sides would do nothing.  Carthage was under siege for something like 15 turns before I got sick of waiting and just used my army to kick out the attacking army so I could conquer the city.  The naval force that had been holding the city, which included a large naval garrison, under seige was two ships.  The same thing happened later on the African coast where one Egyptian naval unit besieged a city for 25+ turns until I finally kicked them out and attacked the city myself.Despite the bugs and problems I'm still really enjoying the game, with a few minor fixes I think this can be equal or even exceed the original.  For the price, you would hope it would come that way out of the box, but I still wouldn't have any reservations about recommending this game to friends, especially if the liked the first one.Good Game With the Potential to be Great\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  This is a fun game, also a great source of exercise great for parties,once you start plaing it you will not want to stopGreens Gr8 Reviews\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  I believe that this game is probably one of worse games in the whole Halo franchise, but is still fun. The campaign is pretty mundane, but it really draws you in to play more. The multiplayer is okay. All it really contains are just new Halo 3 maps, as well as a Nazi-Zombies-esque Firefight mode where hoards of covenant come and attack you.The only downfall to this game is that it is essentially just a Halo 3 add-on.  It is kind of addicting, and is sure to keep you entertained for long gaming sessions whether you are playing along with someone on your console or through Xbox Live, or even solo on the campaign or just building random contraptions in Forge.Although it is essentially just an add-on to the Halo 3 game, it still is pretty fun, but noticeably more difficult to play. If you are waiting until now to buy it, I would just suggest Halo Reach which blows all of the other Halo games out of the water, but this still is a fun one to play.It is really just okay.\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  First of all, I want to address to everyone that is reading that this game was designed for a much younger audience in mind. I believe adults or older teens looking for the more mature Spidy game that followed the recent movie plots should take that in consideration. The title's core gameplay consists of Spider-man and a teammate fighting a bunch of creatures who are under the command of a mysterious enemy. You do nothing else but fight and that is where the problem lies. Maybe the developer wanted to keep it as simple as possible. What is good about the game is that there is a range of Spider-Man's most notable villains that you can play as. Most of their \"special\" moves are refreshing. You earn tokens to buy more of Spider-Man's webbing abilities. You can also upgrade your sidekicks as well. And as one reviewer pointed out, the co-op play deserves credit in the fact that if your partner playing along side of you decides they want to quit, they can do so without losing your game. It is all in the pause menu. I think this is a good rental since beating the game isn't difficult, but playing as some of the other characters are fun. In my opinion, Blade was pretty cool and he should get his own adventure title with all of his arsenal and abilities. Scorpion had some  awesome moves in this game and lets not forget about Sandman.There is fun to be had\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n","Review :  This was the first game I played in the LEGO game franchise. I absolutely loved the gameplay, story, features, character variety, puzzels, etc. Each level is good sized and fairly involved. Each character has a time and place that they need to be used and it's all a part of the giant LEGO puzzle.My biggest complaint is the \"free roam\" play. It gives the player a chance to replay a level and try to figure out all the puzzles and find all the hidden objects. The problem is that the enemies keep respawning. For the most part, they're not difficult to defeat, but it ruins some of the experience when you have to fight the same guys over and over again. It's no big deal since you have infinite lives, it's just frustrating.Overall, it was a good introduction to the LEGO games universe. I would have to recommend the LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean, though, over the Star Wars version.Fun game, but has its weaknesses\n","Sentiment :  Positive\n","-----------\n"]}],"source":["#ACCURACY

Diablo 3 has been fun , but Mac users beware - - while Blizzard says this game is supported for the Mac , any Mac with the Nvidia 9400M video card ( which is many Macbooks , including my 2010 13in Macbook Pro ) will NOT play the game satisfactorily . Even on the lowest graphic settings the game is too sluggish to play ( 5 - 10 FPS ) . At the beginning of the game this lag seems tolerable when there are only a few monsters on the screen , but as you progress into more advanced acts the game slows down to the point where all you do is die to unseen hordes stuttering around the screen . This looks like a fun game , but now I ' ve been forced to buy a new computer or ask for a refund - - it simply cannot play on Macs with Nvidia 9400M cards ! Wait to see if Blizzard fixes this , and the game might be cheaper by then too . Unplayable on Mac\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: THIS GAME LOST MY ATTENTION AFTER LIKE 3 MONTHS !

I definitely do not think that it is worth $ 60 . If it were $ 20 , that may be a different story . I ' ll break it down into pros and cons ( tldr below ) . Pros : * Graphics - Personally , I like the graphics . I understand that they ' re a bit too \" cartoonified \" for some people , but I think they are aesthetically pleasing . The cinematic graphics are awesome as well . * Voice acting - Okay , see the dialogue con for the other side of this story . I think they chose some good voice actors and these actors did a good job . * Combat - The combat is the only thing that keeps me playing this game ( well , that and friends ) . There are definitely flaws in the combat system , but overall it is pretty fun . You get a lot of really flashy and exciting abilities and the bosses are pretty neat , especially on higher difficulties . * Music - Eh , it ' s decent . I didn ' t want to put it as a con , but it ' s far from the best video game music . WoW has a better soundtrack . Cons : * Dialogue / writing - The dialogue and writing in this game are awful . Although I think the voice actors were pretty good , a lot of their acting seemed bad because of how silly the writing was . There were so many cliche and corny lines that I thought I was watching an episode of Power Rangers during some of the cinematics ( I am justice itself ? . . . ) * Customization ( or lack of ) - There is no customization in this game . It ' s absolutely pathetic and makes me think that Blizzard has gone so far downhill that nothing will ever bring them back . ZERO physical customization . Really ? How hard would it have been for them to at least let us slightly customize our characters in a game where we are often playing ONLINE ? Everyone looks identical . It is boring and incredibly lazy . Whoever decided to scrap physical customization should never work in the gaming industry ever again . There is also next to no class customization either ( you can change your abilities whenever ) . This detracts from the replay value IMMENSELY ( as well as the RP potential . . . actually there is NO RP in this game whatsoever . It might as well just be an action game ) . * Controls - The controls are terrible . This was apparent the second I started playing . You have to click to move AND use some of your abilities . I often find myself randomly running around in circles as I ' m trying to click on enemies that are moving or clicking on the ground to loot . I notice my friends doing this too and it is pretty entertaining ( but annoying and poorly designed ) . * Online Requirement - You must be online for single player . Luckily , I find this game mind numbingly boring by myself , so I ' m always playing with friends , but it is still immensely annoying ( lag and dc ' s happen to me with an awesome connection ; that would bug the hell out of me if I was playing alone ) . * Loot - For a game that ' s centered around loot , you ' d think that it would be more exciting . It ' s not . I guess I expected something like WoW or NWN where you have hundreds to thousands of awesome looking , unique armor and weapons ( instead of generic random stuff ) . * Repetition - It ' s just too repetitive . They would have been better off with only 3 difficulties IMO . Having to play the game FOUR TIMES to beat all the difficulties is ridiculous , considering it already gets repetitive during the first play through . * RL $ AH - Just a stupid way for a greedy company to make extra cash . It ' s a bad idea . I have no idea why anyone would even spend real money on gear for their characters in this game when the gear is so unoriginal anyway . You could buy the best legendary armor with $ but then what are you going to do with it ? ? ? The whole point of the game is to GRIND for loot and work your way through the higher difficulties , so this AH defeats the purpose of the game . Why would a gaming company add something that negates the point of their game ? ( I should also say that I think this will add to the hacking and gold selling market ; I ' m already seeing the spam in chat and it will only get worse ) . * The ending - Perfect example of terrible writing . It was cliche , corny , cheesy , anticlimactic , etc . Act 4 felt rushed , then basically the bad guy dies , hooray we are all happy , humans and angels live together forever omg yay ! ! ! What is this a Disney movie ! ? Normally at the end of a video game ( at least a good one ) , I feel a sense of happiness and sadness ( sad that it ' s over , happy at how much fun I had with it ) . At the end of this I felt annoyed . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * TLDR : Fun for a while , especially with friends , but overall cliche , poorly written , repetitive , and has annoying controls and an online requirement . Worth playing , but NOT for $ 60 .

Maybe I should qualify this with a \" yet . \" I think they are trying to fix things , but they have done so many things wrong so far that I just can ' t give this game a good rating . I have been plagued with problem after problem . I have two copies of this game . My girlfriend and my best friend both bought me a copy without speaking with one another . It was very sweet . Well , I also have two computers that can play this game . One is a custom built computer and the other is a Mac . Well I convinced my girlfriend to play with me . The only problem is . . . well , we couldn ' t play the game together . Why , you might ask ? Well , I could install it on my Mac just fine . There was no problem other than the considerable lag . I had to drop the video settings of course , but there was just constant lag . No , I couldn ' t play with her because there was an installation problem on my PC . It took 3 days of troubleshooting to finally figure it out . You know , uninstall , reinstall , re - download the client . Run as admin . Run in XP mode . Nothing worked . No I had to manually kill the agent . exe process and manually start the process from within a folder before I could actually run Diablo 3 and install it . That made it work . None of the other stuff like updating my system , disabling my anti - virus , running in compatibility mode or anything made this game work . So , Blizzard , you failed big on this one . 3 days without being able to play . What was my next problem ? Oh , the constant lag is a constant problem . Updating things like my network adapter and reworking my wiring didn ' t fix anything . Checking my channels to find the best reception didn ' t help . It still lags . The first few days the servers were constantly down . The auction house IS constantly down . The servers are still constantly down for some kind of maintenance . They threw this piece of crap out onto the market before ever really doing much . This doesn ' t feel like 12 years of planning and thinking for a new game . This feels like some piece of crap game they put together in about a year . Then about a week in my buddy gets hacked and loses all of his stuff . Seems odd , but didn ' t surprise me too much as he isn ' t too big on passwords . I knew that . Oh , but a few days later my account gets hacked . Then I am in the forums noticing that there are a lot of people being hacked . Then another friend was hacked . Does this really sound that common to you ? You think people who have been gaming for years get hacked this easily ? No this was a Blizzard problem . Did they help me out ? Sure . . in a way . Let me tell you how they helped me out . First , it took 24 hours to even respond . Then it took another 24 hours for them to let me know that I had to make sure I understood what a \" rollback \" was . How insulting to my intelligence . Then they finally rolled me back after another 24 hours . They didn ' t offer to give me any gold or help me out in any way . I was out millions of gold in items , 150 , 000 gold in definite gold lost from the roll back , a day lost on a character that I was working on , and the lame moderator just makes some snarky comments and says it ' s all taken care of now . Meanwhile the items I did have depreciated badly because the economy changed so quickly . I basically lost 3 - 4 days worth of game time and all kinds of other things because Blizzard is compromised . I made some suggestions for their security , but I am sure it fell on deaf ears . They just want everyone to use their authenticators because they assure everyone is 100 % impossible to hack . Bullcrap . I ' m not even saying it was impossible to hack me before , but it shouldn ' t have been easy . The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I see some changes coming that might make the game worth swallowing in some ways . There are still tons of problems . They are firm on not letting people go \" free world \" in the game like Diablo 2 . You have to select a quest and go from there . It ' s tedious . The farming is tedious . The game is tedious . There is no more rushing really . The leveling is boring . I ' ll be honest . I would have been happy with Diablo 2 with a few changes in there . I wanted similar characters and play styles . They took powerful characters and a fun game and made it tedious . They were even so arrogant as to point out that \" there is no cow level \" on loading screens . Oh , you mean one of the funnest things in Diablo 2 isn ' t in your game anymore and you think that is a good thing ? Oh , let me shake your hand . Then there is this new unicorn level that they make ridiculously tedious ( noticing a pattern here ) to get into . I haven ' t even gone into it yet , because I don ' t feel like trying to farm the 5 - 6 different pieces required and the 100 , 000 gold item to make the level and not gain anything from it other than maybe a few giggles while slaughtering a unicorn .

I have waited a long time , like many , for the third installment to come out . I was able to get it yesterday and installed it today . Though I have a fairly new computer , within a year of purchase and actual age , you worked the game that I would have to spend an extra 30 + dollars in order to play the game . While I understand that you wanted to make the best game possible , you cut off people like myself who haven ' t had the chance of buying an out - in - out game only computer . Thus a $ 60 game jumps to $ 90 - 100 extra dollars within seconds of realizing that I still somehow do not have an advanced video card . I feel let down and left out . I realize that there are a lot of gamers who have such computers already and have topped their computers in order to be able to play such games . I didn ' t realize I had to be in that percent group .

I even got as far as to think that if the game keeps up the good artwork , it would be worthwhile to buy this game just to watch the artwork . But getting to act 3 ( snow ) and seeing the same rocks with just a color change sunk all of my fantastic imaginations about the game ' s aesthetic value . The images are also a bit grainy ; my guess is that the graininess is because Blizzard began designing the game around a decade ago , before screen resolution got to today ' s state .

( yes , Blizzard put me through all of them ) The only things I have to add are : 1 . While I was fighting solo to the final boss , I saw the message \" server will be down for maintenance in 15 minutes . \" Just imagine that you fought so hard to finish the game , and failed because your SINGLE PLAYER server went down for maintenance ! 2 . I only have time for this review because Blizzard is having server issues . Again . = = = = = DIALOGUE = = = = = You would think that , with all the time Blizzard invested into making Diablo 3 , they will have plenty of time to polish the conversations . But instead , it seems that Blizzard ran out of audio / scripting funds from their long years of inactivity and had to cut the dialogue bank short . For most of the dialogues ( including all of the quest dialogues ) , you have 1 set of NPC dialogues that fits all 5 classes , and each class works his / her dialogues around the NPCs ' . The conversations are ok at times , but other times , it just feels like nobody ' s paying much attention to what your hero says . For example , take the following conversation between the Zoltun Kulle ( a ghost ) and your character : If you play monk , you get : Kulle : The Horadrim did all this to lock my body away . They must have been very angry with me . Monk : They couldn ' t kill you . What else can they do ? Kulle : They were never very creative . ( me : yeah , that sort of makes sense to me . So they aren ' t very creative about how to get rid of Kulle . ) And if you play witch doctor , you get : Kulle : The Horadrim did all this to lock my body away . They must have been very angry with me . Witch doctor : Are you surprised ? Few people take betrayal lightly . Kulle : They were never very creative . ( me : huh ? ? what does taking betrayal harshly have to do with creativity ? Kulle , ignoring me is not Cool ! ) = = = = = GAMEPLAY = = = = = This is actually the biggest issue I have about the game . Diablo 3 ' s enemy attacks for normal is divided into 2 categories : attacks that are irrelevant and attacks that kill in 2 hits . And around 90 % of the attacks that matter take the form of an unmoving circle that explodes after 1 - 2 seconds . So the gameplay ( at least for normal ) is basically : you run around , killing everything like you ' re squashing ants , and get blown into pieces because a few enemies casted circles under your feet . This is especially frustrating in acts 3 and 4 , because even one type of normal minion can throw these attacks . It feels like the monster designers ran out of ideas and decided to throw bright circles in every act , hoping to get away with \" we want to test our players ' reflex ! \" = = = = = IS IT WORTH IT ? = = = = = Overall , I ' m glad I got this game for $ 35 . Is it worth it ? No , and far from it . But it ' s better than the pre - order price of $ 60 . And it ' s one of those games which has such an epic predecessor that I simply had to try despite its accumulative 2 - stars . But after Diablo 3 leeched Diablo 2 ' s fan base dry , I will be a lot less tempted to buy Diablo 4 should Blizzard decide to make it . For those who wonder why I still put up with this , it ' s because I already invested $ 35 into it . And because I want to see if anything changes during late game .

Restrictive DRM ( I dislike having to log into a game as if I ' m logging into my email account .

It ' s really unfortunate that the good aspects of Diablo 3 , smoother and faster - paced combat , nice graphics , and diverse class abilities , are completely overshadowed by its faults . Diablo 3 is the most disappointing game I have every played . I was bored with it within two weeks .\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: Diablo 3 . . . one of the most anticipated games in a very long time which broke preorder records . The game was hyped to no end . And why shouldnt it ? Diablo 2 was a great game and still manages to hook players in for being more than 10 years old which is a testament to how good it was . Diablo 3 , however , was a letdown and failure in every possible way , and a slap in the face to fans who have been waiting so long for the third installment . First problem , was of course the launch . Blizzard knew they had a massive amount of people preordering the game . Beta and stress tests were run , so theres no excuse for what happened when the game went live . Servers crashed , and people trying to log in were essentially blocked from playing a game they paid for . The online only play method proved to be a horrible idea that only punished customers and became apparent the first day . Instead of preparing for the launch and overcompensating for the huge demand , Blizzard chose to go the bare minimum route to see just how few servers they could get away with to run the game . It took about a week for the log in issues to be resolved , but even after that , the people that could finally log in were greeted with horrible server lag and pings that were in the 250 - 700 range which meant huge delays with what was happening on screen , and even more trouble for people who attempted to play hardcore mode . The game would freeze up for a few seconds , and you would find your character permanently dead after the server re - synced . To this day the game is still unoptimized and people with higher end systems are still experiencing bugs such as the infamous stuttering problem which was present from the beta and never fixed even though Blizzard said it would be for the release . Blizzard famously adopted the \" it will be released when its finished \" viewpoint on the game . However , seems they didnt stick with that for long since the game was released unfinished , buggy , and missing many features , biggest of all being arena combat and PVP . It was rushed to market to appease stockholders and report financial gains plain and simple . The graphics are a mixed bag . On one side , they dont look terrible and the effects look nice . On the other , the atmosphere is not Diablo at all . Instead of a dark and dreary world , they chose to make it colorful and cartoonish to an extent to mirror World of Warcraft . Gameplay wise , the game was somewhat fun , but only on the first playthrough . Combat and skills work nicely together , yet when you finish the game on normal mode , theres not much more reason to play . The game just gets a little bit harder on the next difficulty , but the story and quests remain exactly the same . Acts 1 and 2 were somewhat interesting and varied . However , Act 3 , and to a higher extent Act 4 , seem very rushed and bland . The storyline for the game was also pretty boring and uninspired and you can tell the people that did the original games had nothing to do with this one . Inferno mode which is the highest difficulty , just turns into grinding mobs to farm high end gear . The drops in Diablo 3 have become extremely rare to get anything good , which means you need to go to the auction house to get halfway decent items . However , this makes the game just feel like pay to win which essentially it is with the addition of the real money auction house . The auction house has also made gold practically worthless . Botters and farmers have driven prices in the auction house to insane levels where it costs 500 million gold or more for decent items , and the value of gold is dropping daily . Blizzard even patched the game to make equipment repairs cost more money so youre constantly fixing your gear and not making any money to buy anything . For $ 60 , there just isnt any value in this game . Its no longer a Diablo game , and I guess that should have been clear since most of the team that made the first two games have left Blizzard . If it didnt have Diablo in the title and was named something else , it wouldnt have sold anywhere as well as it did . They should have just named this World of Warcraft : Heroes or something like that because its exactly what this game is . A WoW spinoff and cash - in attempt by Blizzard to exploit their fans for money . Save your money , its just not worth it for what they did to this game .

Also like other reviewers , I am saddened by the final product . Here is why . 1 . The biggest reason I am so disappointed in D3 is the Real Money Auction House ( RMAH ) . I knew it was going to be in the game , but the thought didn ' t bother me . I ' ve never planned to purchase items or gold with real money . The major problem is that Blizzard has seen fit to design the game so that you will NEED to purchase items and gold from the AH in order to progress without some maddening gear grind that would take a lifetime . In short , they have set the game up to require use of the AH , in order to profit from the resultant transaction fees . 2 . Absolutely terrible online service . This game is required to be connected to the internet at all times while playing , but the company has provided sub - standard service that results in frequent disconnects , server downtime , and constant gameplay lag . For those of you that are familiar with Blizzard games , you know that their past titles have been superb award - winning masterpieces . This is NOT one of them .

Bad Blizzard\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: Diablo 3 has been one of those games that has been labelled as garbage and it ' s really a shame . I believe there are three main complaints against the game : 1 ) Real Money Auction HousePeople feel that this breaks the game because others can come in with real money , do half the work , and be ready to take on the mobs in Inferno . First off , no . You can have the BEST gear in the game , and still get your butt handed to you in Inferno , even with the recent patches ( I ' ve played since day 1 ) . Navigating through mobs in Inferno takes skill , patience , and practice ; regardless of gear . Anyone who claims that a person can just spend $ X dollars in the RMAH , get to Inferno level , and beat it - hasn ' t played Inferno . In fact , I believe this is why Blizzard did not put the RMAH in Hardcore . You realize how much money they could of made ? Things in Hardcore are worth MUCH more than Softcore - yet greedy , horrible Blizzard left the RMAH out . Why ? Because they clearly say that under NO circumstance will you get your character back . Could you IMAGINE the number of morons who would blow hundreds of dollars on HC characters , thinking it would buy them a one - way ticket to dominating Inferno difficulty , then lose their character ( money ) and FREAK ! RMAH being withheld from the Hardcore server was a move where Blizzard chose to not deal with annoyed customers over money - a genuinely greedy company wouldn ' t of cared , wouldn ' t of passed out on the cash cow that RMAH HC could be . Secondly , being mad that someone who works the 9 to 5 and wants to spend some of their hard earned cash on a few items ( or more ) to make them feel more powerful in game is just insane . It ' s THEIR money ! \" But I worked hard without money to get all of this gear ! \" Well , good for you ! * slow clap * And Jack / Jill works hard to get money that they can spend how they want . Get a job , you ' ll know what I mean when I say that sometimes you don ' t have the time to farm ( even if you ' d like to ) but you really want to catch up with your friends that are on Inferno MP - 6 . For the record , I ' ve never used the RMAH - yet I still respect those that make the choice to use it . 2 ) Always Online / Server Error at LaunchAlways online is a feature that many games were forcing long before Diablo ( and soon consoles will be forcing it , too ) . Is it annoying ? Sure , but so are taxes on my paycheck . But at the end of the day , no one want ' s to get ripped off . And while you may not like that you can ' t play Diablo on your laptop during your wifi absent family vacation , Blizzard doesn ' t like that pricks out their steal something they worked hard to make . Granted , you have the right to not like the always - online rule , but to DOWNVOTE it is an unfair marker of the games quality - you ' re essentially saying , \" Even if this was the best game ever made , because it forces me to always be online , I recommend you don ' t buy it . \" Plus , I don ' t want to deal with security issues / hackers / bugs to the game , and alway - online is one way to fight against this . Sucks for you , but I am the one playing the game at the end of the day . Error at Launch . . . Ugh , get over it . It was a mistake . It sucked . And I couldn ' t play Diablo 3 for 12 hours . Am I the ONLY person who is not a game - addict here ? ! The other sentiment is that , \" I paid for it and couldn ' t play it ! \" Firstly , read your terms of service that you accept . Secondly , how often has an employer paid you on the hour while you were texting , goofing off , etc ? Big deal , we ' re human . Mistakes happen . It wasn ' t consistent . 3 ) Grinding / It ' s Just Not the SameREALLY ? ! Does no one remember how much a grind fest Diablo 1 / 2 could be ? Less variety in gear might of meant less grinding , but the expense is less variety ! It ' s a dungeon crawler . . . Of all the complaints I read / hear about the game , I RARELY see \" it wasn ' t fun \" , \" the characters suck \" , \" the skills suck \" , etc . Aka , I RARELY see actual negativity towards the key component - general game play . Too me , it ' s lest of a one - track grind than Diablo 1 / 2 by FAR due to the increase in A . I . When I ' m playing HC on my lv 60 - 3 at Inferno , I ' m always encountering new situations where my heart begins to race as I know the fight is on and my character could bite the dust any moment now . Humans have a tendency to look on the past with an exaggerating positive light . This isn ' t my theory , it ' s fact . Actually listened to a recent TED talk about . Ever had a ex bf / gf / friend , where you find yourself missing them until a friend or some other circumstance makes you realize , \" Wow , it was never as good as I thought it was . . . \" Diablo 1 / 2 are GREAT . AMAZING ! BRILLIANT ! I will always hold them near to my heart , as I played them as a child during a time where they brought a lot of stress - relief to my life and allowed me to bond with my cousin of the same age as we played . I will always owe Diablo 1 / 2 some of my sanity , and I could never betray that game . That being said , when you try and compare the feelings of nostalgia banked by playing D / D2 with the present gameplay of D3 , of course Diablo 3 is going to fail - miserably . But anyone who takes an honest assessment of what makes a game a game - gameplay , A . I . , story , visuals , depth , etc will see that D3 is a MAJOR improvement . Everyone knows that , hypothetically , if Diablo 3 was the \" perfect \" game , it still would have failed because it just can ' t live up to the unrealistic expectations of being a game that is in your heart and has been there for years . It ' s impossible . That being said , I really like the game for the GAME itself .

And this is coming from someone who spent over 100 hours on it and beat the game on Inferno with my Wizard so I ' ve given the game more than its fair chance . The first couple of times of beating the game are very fun , especially with friends , I will hand it to Blizzard . The art is nice , the music is not bad , and the environments are somewhat interesting . Then you reach the brick wall that is known as Inferno ( the hardest difficulty ) and you realize what Blizzard has been planning all along . The mobs in Inferno suddenly become godlike and all your gear becomes instantly obsolete . Elites and even regular mobs will kick your ass unless you upgrade your very quickly . To make matters worse the game PUNISHES YOU for playing co - op on Inferno , the already disgustingly difficult mobs become near godly and unless you and your friends are supremely geared it ' s going to be an excruciating exercise in futility . Problem is that 95 % of the loot you get in Inferno is literally garbage , so bad that even the NPC vendors will be reluctant to accept them . Magic find increases the chances of getting yellow items , but chances are they are still crap . There are far too many possible attributes during item rolls , so as a result you will almost always get items which make no sense whatsoever ( example : Wizard hat with Strength , or Barbarian sword with Intelligence , etc . ) and weapons in Act 4 of Inferno with 200 DPS . It ' s infuriating . It is so bad that when I killed Diablo on Inferno he dropped only blues , and not just any blues but TERRIBLE blues , stuff so bad you wouldn ' t even use it on Hell difficulty . So you ' re thinking to yourself , WHY WHY WHY would they do this ? ! Why make the mobs so difficult and the gear so bad ? ! ? ! WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE REACH THE GOAL OF BLIZZARD ' S GAME DESIGN IN DIABLO 3 : THE REAL MONEY AUCTION HOUSE ! ! ! As stated Inferno is so ridiculously difficult and the loot generally so bad that the ONLY WAY to progress is to use the Auction House . I only managed to beat the game by bidding low gold on items and shopping intelligently , but it took wayyyy longer than it should have . Not only this , I was BASICALLY FORCED TO USE THE AUCTION HOUSE TO BEAT THE GAME . Trust me this isn ' t just unique to me because I suck , 90 % of my friends gave up at Inferno Act 1 , those that stayed have had no choice but to use the Auction House as well . The game isn ' t skill dependent , it is only gear based . PROBLEM IS that the gold prices of items have flown through the roof due to inflation , botters , and exploiters . So expect to see any half decent weapon for at least 10 million gold , which is no small amount of money . So a lot of people have resorted to using the Real Money Auction House and it ' s absolute chaos . I ' ve seen people spending over $ 500 ( yes real cash ) on a SINGLE ITEM , a virtual item folks that will probably be obsolete in the next patch or expansion . I personally don ' t believe in spending real money on video game items ( especially absurd amounts like stated above ) but to each his own . - - - - - So I really can ' t help but feel like the entire game was designed to revolve around the Real Money Auction House . The difficulty is absurd at inferno , many of the bosses are basically gear - checks ( can only be beaten with certain amounts of DPS ) and the loot is so bad that you have no choice but to use the Auction House . This game is a money grab , it ' s pay to win , and I ' m not sticking around for when they implement Player vs . Player where it ' s going to be the battle of the credit cards . I will admit that I got more than my money ' s worth and it was fun at times , but this franchise has been ruined and this is by FAR the worst Blizzard game I have ever played .

This game was over 11 years in the making and when it finally was released it was filled with bugs , exploits , server issues , and no single player offline mode . You are required to connect to the servers in order to even play a game by yourself , the reasoning behind this is that it prevents people from making illegal copies and / or duping or hacking the game . Fine , but what it also does is limit your ability to play a product you paid for , you cannot play if you have no internet connection , if the servers are down or out , or your connection is not \" stable \" ( NZ and Australian players know this fact ! ) . Why not add a single player mode only that cannot then be transferred online for play for those who wish to enjoy the game when the internet is not an option or the servers are out ? Aside from the glaring requirement of being connected in order to play there are the issues with the game play itself . Things like \" rubberbanding \" and latency cause your character to just suddenly die , issues further compounded by insane graphical requirements even at the lowest of settings . Systems that run over 1 GB of video memory still experience framerate stutter and tearing on a game with graphics less intense than something made 5 years ago . This is owed to the MPQ files that are used as a resource to render the world , these objects are stored on the Hard Drive and must be accessed constantly to generate the terrain . This means that they are subject to read time delays , even fast 10 , 000 RPM disks are going to struggle to keep up . The best solution has been to store these files on a SSD separately , which is a ridiculous fix that should not need to be implemented simply to make the game run smoothly . The game itself is a progression , like Diablo 2 or Dungeon Siege 2 , beating certain difficulties unlocks more challenging ones . However the story is exactly the same , the enemies simply get harder to kill . This means there is no real end game . For those that have \" seen it all \" and \" done it all \" , such as beating the hardest difficulty or mastering the \" Hardcore Mode \" ( another failed attempt to challenge players , what good is a 1 death system when things like lag or framerate issues can kill you as surely as any enemy ) this means the game has no replay value whatsoever . There is nothing to do but wait for more content to be released . A ladder system or PvP such as was introduced in D2 would alleviate this , but Blizzard prefers to invest time in their cash cow , the Real Money Auction House ( RMAH ) . Which brings me to my final point , the game is custom designed to make good items hard to find so that players will be forced to resort to buying the items they need to proceed . It is in Blizzard ' s best interests to make good items hard to get , because if everyone can get them on their own no one will sell them in the RMAH and Blizzard will not receive its commissions . The economy of the game is of course broken because the people with all the good items are the botters , hackers , exploiters , and cheaters who took advantage of loopholes and continue to take advantage of the game in order to profit . These people , for the most part , work out places like Korea and China , dedicating untold hours to grinding the game in order to gather their loot which they then sell at premium prices to those too ignorant or desperate to know better than to buy them . This game was fundamentally flawed in the way it was developed , released , and is now currently being managed . Blizzard needs to stop the RMAH and increase the drop rates of quality items across the board . This is a game people play for fun in order to challenge themselves to get better at it , not a money making endeavor that is meant to line the pockets of the company that made it . For these reasons I have stopped playing the game , since I received my copy for free when I purchased a yearly subscription to World of Warcraft I am one of the few fortunate souls who was not robbed for 60 dollars for a failure of a product .

Good game\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: This game is just depressingly bad . The entire game is built around an auction house that to the very core is featureless and hard to use . You are limited to 3 filters on an item search . You cannot filter by those search filters . You cannot filter by bid value or duration left . The game is designed around a cookie cutter for total morons . Basically Blizzard tells you how to play the game every step of the way . How to build your character . What stats you should gear for , what skills to use , etc . They have consistently let exploiters go unpunished , while at the same time nerfing legitimate player builds citing that they are too powerful . The economy is so inflated due to only being able to post 10 items every 3 days on the auction house . THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL DESIGN . Blizzard wants to encourage people not to play their game legitimately rather than spend their money in the RMAH buying items . The final difficulty mode ( Inferno ) is designed so that players brick wall upon entering every new act . This too is done to intentionally force players to visit the auction house ( RMAH or otherwise , it is impossible to collect the gear necessary to advance . ) Overall , a low quality game . I give it 1 / 5 stars .

Not only were the servers screwed up on launch day , not allowing anyone on until about 4pm eastern time , but anytime their servers are clogged , your SINGLE PLAYER game gets lagged an unplayable . I just had to close the game because I was walking around on a single player game and no mobs were generating lag was making the game unplayable . That ' s unacceptable . I paid $ 60 for this game , and I can ' t play a single player game because of lag ? That ' s crazy . I hear blizzard has been making this the norm lately ( StarCraft2 ? ) , and if it continues , I ' ll never buy one of their games again . It ' s understood for an mmorpg like WoW , but for a single player game ? It ' s really something that gamers should rebel over . Bad : The game itself is nothing to write home about . It ' s no different than diablo 1 or 2 . Actually , it ' s super dumbed down . It only allows you to map 4 skills to your 1 - 4 keys ( Q is for your potion ) , and you only get access to the higher numbers when you ' ve gained enough levels . You can ' t mix and match skills to your hot keys , and make the most of your character . And the game ? It ' s exactly like the previous ones , only more boring since you ' ve already seen it before . Bunch of monsters come , you mow them down , and nothing new or exciting happens . It ' s incredibly linear , and just ho hum . It ' s playable , don ' t get me wrong , but it ' just not exciting or really fun in any way . This is not worth it .

It just made sense . Many of my friends were playing this game . This was the most hyped game in the history of PC gaming thus far . So , I gave it a try . The first time through the game was amazing . But , as you go along , there are far too many limitations and unpolished aspects of the game . The Good * The heroes . There are a wide variety classes - The Barbarian , Monk , Demon Hunter , Witch , and the Wizard . Lots of different characters to play with . Barbarian for the close range , physical prowess . Demon Hunter for the long range sniping and shooting ability . Witch and Wizard with spells and spiritual powers . * Beautiful settings . Dirt , night , day , villages , fire , hell , heaven , everything looks gorgeous * The first time through the game is epic , until the very last ACT . The ACT was just disappointing . I couldn ' t even believe when I killed Diablo . I figured it should have been a bit more difficult . Still , the first half and through the first part of the 2nd half is pulse pounding fun . * Looting . It ' s quite fun . And addictive . * Armor and weapons upgrading . Highly addictive to a certain extent . There are attributes that make certain armor and weapons more appealing , including vitality , regeneration , gold find , and so forth . The Bad , Bad , Bad * Required online log in . What ? Are you kidding me ? I have to log in and stay online just to play by myself . I should never have to lag when I am playing alone . A hiccup in internet connection is all it takes to die . If that happens in hardcore , oh that is no good at all . * No voice chat function . That makes no sense at all . Valve has succeeded and made it a standard . It makes absolute no sense to force players to use the in - game text chat or other external programs like skype and ventrilo . Shame on Blizzard . * The additional modes are not appealing . After you finish the game once , you enter Nightmare mode , and so forth . However , aside from higher difficulty , different items , and tougher monsters , there is really no difference . The same thing , again and again . * I expected the graphics to be much better and refined . Zoomed in , the game just looks horrible and blocky . I had a wonderful and enjoyable time finishing the game first time through . After that , I began to mope around and wander around trying to find some reason to keep playing the game . So I tried selling armor and weapon . I purchased armor and weapons from the auctions . I wanted to improve my hero ' s overall makeup . Then , that got old .

If the servers are down you cannot play , if you lose or do not have a constant internet connection you cannot play the game you just paid 60 dollars for and there is no excuse for that . . . . it ' s beyond stupid and ignorant to the players . As a game this is a classic and for me a great addition to the series with amazing new and classic moments , but again the always on DRM is it ' s ruination . Due to DRM In a few years when this is no longer profitable to Blizzard and they shut down the servers you can never play your game again which is total BS and a waste of money , if they are doing that crap the game should be free and pay monthly to play it not pay 60 dollars to have a limited play time . I heard they will be releasing an expansion which is sorly needed as the game is kind of short and afterwards there isn ' t much to do other than log in from time to time to slay demons and play through the game again which is fun in itself but gets boring . DRM is disgusting and we as players need to let the game industry know with our wallets that DRM like this is not acceptable . Fix you lag plagued servers or give us offline mode . Update : Now the servers a re even laggier , more disconnects , more rubber banding and blizzard does nothing . . . . also we get the pleasure of having 15 + gold spam request a day in our inbox when we log in . . . . again reported over and over , on the forums . . . blizzard does nothing .

I wanted to give the game a fair shot and allow Blizzard to patch the problems that exist . I also was an early Beta participant . Now after weeks of playing the game , I simply wish I had not invested the time or the money in this game . I think the best way to describe this game is in terms of generalities . Listing too many specific instances doesn ' t give the reader a since of my frustration or disappointment . So here goes : The patches they had added don ' t address the real issues and sometimes make the game even less fun . The game appears to not have been tested much at all for inferno levels . The game looses its fun factor extremely fast once you hit inferno . Legendary gear is completely worthless . All the fun affixes that Diablo 2 had are replaced by utterly boring and worthless affixes . You don ' t feel more powerful as you reach high levels . Grinding gear is slow , painful , and boring for inferno . The voice over acting is horrible . The plot line is thin . The character lines are cheesy , cliche ridden garbage that try to be funny but aren ' t . Makes the game feel like it was made for a 10 year old . Bottom line is this . After playing Diablo 3 , I decided Diablo 2 was far and away a better game and reinstalled it rather than continue playing Diablo 3 . Completely dissapointed after waiting 10 + years .

Then I actually loaded this piece of trash onto my computer . That ' s when I found out that Blizzard had invented a brand - new feature for single - player games : massive , crippling lag . It ' s a surprising bonus , since you ' ve just spent the last 30 minutes installing untold gigabytes of data onto your computer . Yet somehow , the thing needs to constantly pull data from the Internet - even though there ' s no one in dungeon but you . You click , you wait , you die - often with no idea why .

Tons of them . Errors that could have been fixed during this game ' s literal decade of development . Yes , you read that correctly , it took more than a decade to create this garbage . Yet you ' ll find constant errors that kick you out of the game , reset your character and shut off your game permanently . Yes , it sounds like it ' s made - up , but it ' s not . For instance , I was lucky enough to encounter an error 316704 ( party error ) which kicked me out of the game and wouldn ' t allow me to return . The confusing part was , I wasn ' t in a party . I was playing a single - player game . Blizzard managed to spend 11 years developing a game that doesn ' t run properly , and isn ' t very fun - even when it ' s not shutting itself down . The fact is , most of these problems could have easily been fixed by not requiring an Internet connection to play an offline game . But that would have been too obvious . Better to be clever and release a game that no one can ever hope to play without losing all their progress to a random blip in cyberspace . When Diablo 3 does run , it ' s mildly amusing , sort of like Torchlight except worse . So if you like that , then you ' ll like this in a few months when the glitches have been dealt with .

So my first problem with the game is its just point in click , like its still 1999 . You are pretty much forced to play the game with just the mouse , pretty much as long you have a hand and 2 fingers you will do fine . I would have liked the game set to modern standards , as in full 3D behind the shoulder camera not over the top and proper controls . My second problem is you have to be online to play single player . Which i understand cause it prevents people hacking and cheating and selling items on the AH but at the same time i shouldnt be forced to play online to play a singleplayer game . Heck many times i lag cause Blizzard servers suck . My third problem is the game gets boring fast , So on my first playthough it was fun , i took my time finished it at around 25 hours , so then i have to play on nightmare mode doing the same thing as normal mode but harder monsters , and then repeat on hell mode and repeat on inferno . Now once you get to inferno you have to grind for HOURS AND HOURS to get by , Once you complete act 1 inferno , you need to grind for 20 - 50 hours JUST to gear up and stand a chance in Act 2 Inferno . Its boring doing the same old thing over and over and over . My forth problem is that , game has been out for nearly a month YET its Auction house is still not working right . Not only that we were suppose to have Real money Auction house on the 22nd of may and still dont have it . My fifth problem is , like MMOs , the game has to have server maintenance of 6 - 8 hour downtime . Never have i played a \" single player game \" where i have to deal with weekly 8 hour maintenance . Lastly my sixth problem is HACKS . A lot of people are getting hacked left and right . Why ? I dont know . Never have i played a game with so many people getting hacked . Nice security blizzard has . Even with the authenticator people are still getting hacked . Overall this really isnt a good game . While it was fun for a while , its just a boring grind now . I regret buying this game .\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: At first all I saw was red health bars everywhere I looked , so I disabled them . Then damage numbers burnt images into my vision ; had to disable those too . Needless to say , it can be fun to grind eq hoping for that small gain in power , but it ' s VERY repetitive grinding the same areas over and over and crafting LOTS of times to get something decent ( which requires grinding for resources ) . Blizzard did a lot of work revamping this game and many improvements were made ( I added 2 stars as a result ) . The eq is among the best in gaming and requires math , research , and testing to make it work with the huge variety of skills / ways to play your character . Unfortunately the work they did was to finish the game , which was only mediocre when released . This work requires pay , which will come from buying the game ( again ) to play as ' reaper of souls ' which has more areas to grind and another character class people seem excited about . The game is simply not good enough to buy twice . Wait for a GOTY or package deal and don ' t pay more than current value for 1 game ( around $ 60 ) . Publishers need to learn that when consumers make a purchase , they expect a finished game instead of being double charged and having to roll with the punches of massive game changing patches which render some of your previous efforts a waste . good work improving Blizz but I ' ll spend no more $\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: I waited to buy this game because of all the launch issues it was having . After a week or two my friends really wanted me to go get it . So I strolled down to the local gamestop and bought the download . I was really stoked to play it . My friends and I played on easy and after act 1 i just got bored of it . My guy is level 15 an I have stopped playing . I honestly want to return it . The story didn ' t grasp my attention at all . I felt like I spent half of my time getting the best items and not playing the game . I also am disappointed there is no multiplayer my friend said they were making it .

I am a hardcore fan of the Diablo series and it is clear that Blizzard made horrible decisions in the production of this game . 1 ) Online Only Play2 ) Only 4 People can Play Together instead of 8 in Diablo 23 ) Every Character will have Every Spell in Equal Amounts . I feel like a Marxist created this game . I have no desire to recreate a character to give him different abilities , skill points , and vitality / strength / dexterity / intelligence points because everyone has the same everything if you are the same class ! This means PVP will be solely based on items , and possibly skill selection . And everyone will use the same skills most likely in PVP . I watched a Blizzard developer in an interview basically say that they had a hard time balancing skill point development so they just got rid of it . Yeah well they ruined the game in part due to that . 4 ) The storyline is a saturday morning cartoon , but less entertaininng . The voiceovers are horrible . Characters do not even move their lips in movies when they talk , or if they do it is hardly noticeable . 5 ) Questing is like someone is holding your hand . The minimap pings where you need to go . Every quest is basically \" find this location or person \" . And there is nothing unique about it . You do not have to match symbols on a wall like in the old Diablo 2 Act 2 or get a horadric cube to make a staff or ANYTHING . It is so cheap and dumbed down . Basically the whole game feels like a boss fight . CLICK CLICK CLICK . 5 ) The auction house idea was horrible . Now players willing to give blizzard more money are basically the winners and the people actually playing to find items will suffer . 6 ) The Monk is overpowered and the Barbarian sucks ( I am level 33 ) . 7 ) There are not enough classes . 8 ) Every act is monotonous boring . CLICK CLICK CLICK . The game as a whole is not that long though . 9 ) Online only play and no LAN play10 ) Some Monsters are taken directly out of WoW . That is just a short list , but you get the idea . I have not even mentioned the fact that in the first 2 - 3 days the servers have been down half the time . So much for that stress test or beta being any help . This game basically feels like I am repeating 5 quests on WoW 8 hours at a time to complete an Act . Koreans are beating this game in under 2 hours . Ever since Blizzard screwed up SC2 ( fast paced click fest now ) I have questioned how they just remake a game , but screw it up and call it a sequel . The old blizz developers are off working for new companies . If Blizzard were smart they would bring them all back . There was so much more depth in Diablo 2 , and even Diablo 1 . There are no meta games in Diablo 3 . I could teach a chimpanzee to play this game . The quests just really ruined it for me . I feel like I am playing a cartoon dumbed down version of Diablo 2 . Do not even buy this for the novelty because there is none . I will play this for one week at most and then I will probably never play it again .

( I have the collector ' s edition which is why I don ' t show up as a ' verified purchase ' ) THE GOOD : = = = = = = = = = 1 . Fun to playIt ' s still fun to play , although it is still the same mindless , hack and slash , quasi - RPG game that the previous two are . 2 . Decent presentationGraphics and sound ( music / sound effects / etc ) are pretty solid , if uninspired . 3 . Isometric viewI am really glad that they did not turn this game into a first person view game , like Bethesda did with Fallout 3 . THE BAD = = = = = = = 1 . Server \" issues \" ' Nuff said . Surprising given that it took Blizzard 12 years to come out with this game . 2 . Quasi - RPG , with NO CHARACTER BUILDS / CUSTOMIZATION ( i . e . LITTLE REPLAY VALUE ) Nothing is permanent , including character ' development ' . By choosing to not allow players to increase specific character attributes ( dexterity , strenth , etc . ) , Blizzard really took out the \" quasi \" in \" quasi - RPG \" . It ' s actually a straight up action game , with skills automatically unlocked automatically based on XP the SAME FOR EVERYONE . So absolutely ZERO character customizations . Forget about agonizing over how to develop your character , because Blizzard has decided to dumb it down for you and make everything possible at any time . Don ' t like your current skills ? Well , just choose another one , they ' re all available after all ! Ridiculous decision and quite possibly the worst thing about this game . 3 . Complete Re - hash of Diablo II ( i . e . NOT VERY INTERESTING TO PLAY THE FIRST TIME ) This game is basically D2 with updated graphics and worse voice acting and absolutely zero atmostphere . The maps seem so familiar that you could probably do the entire game from memory even if you have never played it before , as long as you have played D2 . Specifically . . . 4 . Lack of Randomized dungeons ( i . e . LOW REPLAY VALUE ) Everything is in the same location , or so it seems at least . The continental maps are the same , so everytime you play a game online you join the mad rush of players all running towards destinations like rats who have mastered a maze . The ' dungeons ' ( there are actually few dungeons ) , or locations , all seem to be minimally varied at all game to game . This makes the game lose a lot of its REPLAY VALUE . Let ' s say that this game has very low replay value unless you want to play all the characters through all the difficulty levels and get them all up to level 60 or whatever the highest level is . No point in ever playing the same class twice , since there is no ' build ' anymore for characters . 5 . Lack of AtmosphereIt really looks like WoW in an isometric view . Completely gone is the claustrophobic , disturbing , and foreboding atmosphere of D1 . Everything looks cartoonish , which is exacerbated by the veritable fireworks display of all colors everytime you use just about any skill . Not to mention that many weapons have a neon glow to them even when not in use . Don ' t be surprised to see a barbarian running around with bright neon orange and green axes in his hands . And a coop battle looks like you ' re at some kind of a rave or Phish concert . 6 . MiscellaneousBad writing , distracting attempts at humor , very poor voice acting ( especially Leah ) , and tedious intro / cutscenes .

Add a few new \" goods \" and \" bads \" for this game . . . GOOD = = = = 1 . Better CutscenesThe ones at the end are better than the earlier ones ( e . g . it ' s possible to watch it through without hitting ESC ) . 2 . Still Fun ( for now . . . ) Yes , it is still fun to play , despite the numerous deficiencies mentioned previously . Once I finish the game on the hardest difficulty , I cannot imagine playing it again until the inevitable expansion pack ( s ) comes out . I will play all the difficulty levels though and the expansion packs , which should say something about the casual playability of this game . Despite the limitations on and simplification of character development , it is still fun to ' unlock ' new skills to use . Much of the fun does derive from leveling ( read : grinding ) and item collection ( who doesn ' t still love to collect rare , unique , and now legendary items ? ) . BAD = = = 1 . Too SHORT ! ! ! ( i . e . LOW REPLAY VALUE ) Maybe 15 - 20 hours and I finished the game in normal difficulty , and I cannot believe how SHORT THIS GAME IS . It ' s shocking actually , and it does not help that the acts are so similar to D2 . For some reason I expected this game to be much longer and expansive compared with D2 , similar to how D2 was much more immense in scope compared with D1 . But no , there are still just 4 ( I think ) acts that are fairly short and easy to complete . 2 . Lame Bosses / Lairs ( i . e . Zzzzzz . . . ) Most of the bosses in D3 are pretty lame . Half of them are just gigantic , bulbous and obese monstrosities that are barely distinguishable from one another . Only Diablo himself appears significantly unique . The lairs are similarly boring . . . most are just gigantic square rooms that you run around endlessly trying to avoid getting injured . The boss action , of course , is pure ' grinding ' at its finest . In the later acts , the bosses are almost back to back to back , which to be quite honest got tired really fast , especially when they all seemed the same . 3 . Horrible Skill Interface / System ( i . e . FORGET ABOUT SWITCHING THEM IN A BATTLE ! ) Yes , the way that you switch between skills is very cumbersome and involves opening up a skills window and then clicking on various tabs to select different skills and their runes ( which are not physical items either ) that was not intuitive at all at the beginning , and even when you get used to it still prevents easy switching of skills . Fine , let there be a ' cool off ' time for switching skills , but requiring the skills window to open up in order to change skills is beyond annoying and really means you ' re not likely to do it in a battle . So , that means that essentially you ' re stuck with a half dozen skills , max , at any given time . This feels very limited and boring , especially when you have all these skills that you unlocked and would like to use with some variety to keep things fun . 4 . Linear Gameplay ( i . e . GO FROM A > B > C > D . . . ) More so than D1 or even D2 , D3 is super linear . There is very little exploration you can do except for on the world maps , and even then there are blockades that need to be unlocked as part of some quest or another , limited your ability to explore . OVERALL = = = = = = = It is still a fun game but very disappointing in many ways . Primarily the lack of character attribute / skill customization ( e . g . no ' builds ' ) , the sense of deja vu that you get when you play due to the game being so similar in design to Diablo 2 , and the small scope of the game . I couldn ' t believe that Diablo came so soon , and when he died I was wondering if there would be another act or something , but alas , it just ended with a whimper and yet another cutscene . 3 / 5 for mindless fun2 / 5 for overall quality of the game * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ( UPDATED ( 5 / 20 / 2012 ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * BOTTOM LINE = = = = = = = = = = = So , I got my character up to level 50 and finished D3 on nightmare difficulty and . . . I just uninstalled it . The truth is , the more you play , the higher level you achieve , the less you want to continue playing . This mostly is a result of the lack of character development / customization ( and by that , I mean inability to assign attribute points or selectively develop / specialize skills as in D2 ) and the overall similarity to D2 . The over - simplication ( and let ' s not forget that D2 was a pretty simple game to begin with . . . hardly real RPG type character development or gameplay ) really is the downfall of this otherwise serviceable game . The bottom line is - - it ' s just not that fun to play over and over again . It ' s also laughable that Blizzard is trying to squeeze even more money out of their fans pockets with the Auction House , which no normal person would ( or could ) actually use to try to make money off of the game . I remember selling various items from D2 on ebay ( remember the ' grandfather sword ' anyone ? ) but it ' s hard to imagine that anyone would do the same with this game . In the end , I have to say that while fun for awhile , D3 is ultimately a massive disappointment to fans of the series . For me , it provided less than a week of gameplay , unlike D2 that I played for months and months . It is not the kind of Blizzard product that the company built its reputation on during the 1990s and 2000s , and is clearly showing the unfortunate influence of big company marketing in the development of one of its most popular franchises . Unless the direction that Blizzard takes with their games ( e . g . dumbing down and simplifying their games to achieve more widespread appeal ) changes , I will NOT be buying another Blizzard product ever . Thank God for Kickstart , which has brought back the possibility of independent game development back from the dead ( Wasteland 2 ! ! ! ) . . . Final ( downgrade ) Rating : 2 / 5 for brief , mindless fun1 / 5 for overall quality of the game * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * UPDATED ( 6 / 1 / 2012 ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Yes , I know I said the last update would be the last but I had a few things to add . So , I have the collector ' s edition ( completely worth the $ 100 given all the goodies it comes with ) , which includes D2 / LOD on a USB flash drive . After uninstalling D3 ( after 6 days of gameplay getting my Demon Hunter up to lvl 50 and finishing on nightmare difficulty ) , I decided to see how D2 looked and played ( haven ' t played it since 2001 , after getting the LOD expansion pack ) after all these years . Well , D2 / LOD is still great ! I ' ve been playing for about two weeks ( more than twice the time I played D3 for ) , building a Werebear Druid , and I am amazed with the superiority of this game over the follow - up that took 12 years to be released but feels like a cheap imitation of the real deal . MORE BAD THINGS ABOUT DIABLO 3 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 1 . HAND - HOLDING AND DUMBED DOWN GAMEPLAY ( e . g . D3 NEEDS TO APPEAL TO THE TABLET GAMER CROWD ! ! ) Yes , the geniuses at Blizzard decided that D3 had to be super noob friendly to help ensure the most widespread adoption by casual gamers . So , LOOT that drops from monsters for each player in a multiplayer game INDIVIDUALLY , which other players cannot see let alone pickup . I mean , how stupid is that ? It makes no sense for this to happen and is an example of extent of the absurd hand - holding and ' noob - ification ' of this game . Another example is the ELIMINATION of the use of TOWN PORTAL or IDENTIFY scrolls . What a hassle to use those items when Blizzard could just simplify the game to get rid of them , and instead allow players to press a button at any time to magically teleport themselves back to town ( complete with a silly animation of the players crouching and white energy balls emanating from their hands ) , right ? And identify scrolls , a RPG staple from the earliest days , well , why not get rid of that silly hassle too and allow players to identify any item just by right clicking on it ? Frustrated by having to explore the square continental MAPS searching for important locations ( well , the first time you play through that is , because those locations don ' t appear to ever change ) ? Well , no problem because the good folks at Blizzard have decided that exploration is a waste of time and so they make ARROWS and other indicators appear on the map that SHOW YOU WHERE TO GO , and if you are close to an important place . Yes D2 act 1 had a road that would lead you to adjacent maps , but nothing even close to this level of hand - holding . Can anyone really question the noob - ification and extreme linearness of this game ? There ' s not even an option to turn those map ' hints ' / guides off . Yet another example is the noob - ification of the GEAR REPAIR / durability system . In D3 , items have a durability rating ( e . g . 24 / 24 ) but that never seems to decrease ( or at least , very slowly ) , despite using your weapons and taking damage . Even if an item does break you can simply get it FIXED by the blacksmith guy , so really what was the point ? In D2 ( and other RPGs ) , you fix your gear so that it doesn ' t break because typically you can ' t just weld a broken sword back together again ! And of course , don ' t forget that monsters now drop HEALTH ORBS that raise your life instantly when you walk over them , instead of health potions that needed to be then be consumed in order to get healed . So , yes - - Diablo 3 has been SIMPLIFIED and DUMBED DOWN to the level of an arcade side shooter game . Hell , it ' s basically Sonic the Hedgehog with gear grinding ! 2 . ABSURD STORYBy now most Diablo fans have heard about the absurd and cringe - inducing story of D3 ( I won ' t ' spoil ' it for those of you who haven ' t played it yet , but it involves a human and a certain demon mating and producing a very annoying NPC ) . D2 , on the other hand , had a reasonably interesting and fairly well thought out ( if not particularly original ) story of the ' Dark Wanderer ' ( your character from D1 ) , which provides the backdrop for D2 . And don ' t even get me started on the most ridiculous NPC from the Diablo series , Leah . . . 3 . 4 - PLAYER CO - OP LIMITEight player co - op games in D2 are great - - too bad you ' re limited to only four players in D3 . Just stupid . 4 . OTHER BATTLE . NET ISSUESThe game creation system for multiplayer co - op has also been simplified , in a bad way . You can ' t name your games or even play in a game with other players unless you are on the same exact quest . It ' s very limiting and substantially decreases the online replay value ( which is not very high to begin with , unfortunately ) . 5 . SILLY D1 ' BOSS ' CAMEOYes , you ' ve all heard the rumors / spoilers about the return of a Diablo 1 boss ( arguably the most famous and well - liked boss from the Diablo series ) in D3 . No , it makes no sense why this character , who was killed in D1 , would return ( complete with memorable catchphrase ) , but apparently Blizzard thought this would be some sort of a ' treat ' for Diablo fans . It ' s not . 6 . DEMON HUNTER WEARS STILETTO HEELSSeriously ? In hindsight , this probably should have tipped me off as to the quality of the game that I was so eagerly awaiting . CONCLUSION = = = = = = = = = = Don ' t believe all those ' expert ' reviews on the internet , like the mindboggling 100 % rating ( ! ! ) from Joystiq . These online blogs are hardly objective to any degree , due to direct advertising revenue they receive from game companies and / or other perks they may receive ( e . g . being invited to Blizzard headquarters for exclusive sneak peaks , etc . ) that unduly influences their game reviews . In light of this , it is unsurprising that there are so many highly favorable reviews for D3 . This does not obscure the fact that Diablo 3 is simply a mediocre game . Actually , it ' s below average . It gets a 1 star rating from me because of how much worse of a game in many ways ( gameplay , battle . net , etc . ) it is than its predecessor , the great Diablo 2 despite how long it took ( 12 years , holy smokes ! ) to finally come out , and because of Blizzard ' s thinly veiled primary objective of squeezing as much money out of players with the Real Money Auction House - - a feature that detracts from the item finding fun of the game to a significant degree . Bottom line ? Diablo 3 is fun to play . . . for a few days . The problem is that it lacks much of the substance which made Diablo 2 , and even Diablo 1 , so much more engaging to play . . . and play again and again . Perhaps the most accurate description is that D3 is an uninventive and unoriginal reworking of a great game , with deal - breaking noob - ification and over simplifaction of gameplay dynamics and online play . I would recommend waiting for the inevitable , and likely imminent , price drop before picking this one up .

Anyone who has bought and played any \" Blizzard \" game when the game ( or expansion ) came out knows this .

With Diablo 3 though , it has completely changed how I view the company . Diablo 3 ' s gameplay is very fun and I leveled a witch doctor at midnight on 5 / 15 / 12 . I then realized though my class was severely gimped in inferno to due pets dying instantly . I have since then leveled a 60 of every class in the game and got a hardcore character to 52 ( died due to a server hiccup on Blizzard ' s server ) . With that said , the future aspects of the game were poorly designed and even the developers don ' t know what they ' re doing . After grudging through the poor story three times in normal , nightmare and hell difficulties , you ' re met with inferno . Blizzard wanted to add an \" end game \" feel to Diablo 3 and made this difficulty what they call \" hard \" by making you one - shot every time and coming up with almost invulnerable champion combinations . I can take a major difficulty like this if I am rewarded for it after defeating them . In Diablo 3 though , the loot is so random that even if you did receive the top tier ilvl 63 item , it ' s likely - hood of being a complete dud is very high . After doing this for a couple of weeks and not finding any upgrades , I was absolutely done with the game . The major way you ' ll receive upgrades in this game is buy collecting gold / using real world money and buying items off their auction house , which leads me to my major complaint . Last week I decided to sell off all of my items and quit the game since it ' s not fun at all anymore ( unlike Diablo 2 , which was fun for over five years for me ) . In the process , I sold my items in Blizzard ' s RMAH . All of my items sold , but I never received the funds for one of my items . After six days , I contacted Blizzard ' s CSR reps and was told he / she say the auction failed and asked me what I saw on my screen . My AH screen said the item had sold , processed and completed and I didn ' t have the item anymore . When I replied , another CSR replied back and responded to me as if I was using the gold AH and told me they cannot recover any items and they cannot proceed with any action . I was FURIOUS that I was being brushed off like that when it was involving real money that Blizzard now owes me . I once again replied letting them know that this is real money we ' re speaking about and how I wasn ' t going to let them just drop me like that . I let them know I am contacting the BBB and for the CSR rep to have a beer on me . . . literally . Another CSR rep responded and told me to give it more time and see if the funds are deposited later in the week . So , I ' ve waited their 3 - 5 days they say it can take in extreme cases to receive my funds , and now they ' re telling me to wait longer . I will wait another week , but I have lost all faith in Blizzard and will never purchase another Blizzard game . It saddens me that a game I had been waiting for seven years has completely destroyed how I feel about Blizzard . Thanks Blizzard , it was a fun 14 years . Update 8 / 2 / 2012Still haven ' t received the money from my one auction . I have since contacted the BBB and filed a complaint against Blizzard Entertainment . Beware of the RMAH .

Yes , you ' re going to think that I got 200 hours of enjoyment out of it , but no I didn ' t . I kept reading that if I get to X section or X level or X difficulty or X gear that the game comes alive . 700 days played in World of Warcraft . Thousands of hours played in D2 . Having played many Blizzard games I kept giving this trash the benefit of the doubt but finally realized it was nothing but Blizzard fan boys talking and quit . I believed in Blizzard Entertainment . I really , really did . From the start the game is doomed as the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese . Then you ' re expected to play the game in a group where one guy always clicks skip story . Playing solo is futile as your gear drops will be for another class , thus you need different classes in your group to share the loot . Sounds pretty stupid right ? It is trust me . What if the other guy in the group doesn ' t want to share ? You get nothing . Fun huh ? So at this point you ' re stuck buying gear off the auction house for either millions of gold or real money . This game is all about the fun of looking on the auction house for gear to beat a level . Pure fail Blizzard ! Pure fail ! Then there are issues with the game ' s difficulty as it makes you play the game out on beyond easy mode where I lost 3 friends to boredom . They refused to finish the first difficulty as they literally danced in the fire , intentionally got hit , and never died . They said the game was crap and quit . The game doesn ' t get decent until the 3rd time you ' ve played it through . So you have to play the exact same game 3 times before you get a challenge unless you fall asleep at the keyboard from boredom and die . If you get to a section you can ' t get past just buy some gear off the auction house and more than likely you ' re back to god mode again . Last point I want to touch on is that the game ' s end game is nonexistent . As in it ' s hard not because it ' s fun , but because it cheeses you into death . I play a Demon Hunter and most everything can one shot you unless you invested hundreds of million in gold into your gear . Then you can last for 3 hits ! So assume you ' re not the type of person to spend real money on the auction house . So you ' re going to get a ton of one hit deaths when you try to kill elite mobs . You might die 9 times to a mob if you ' re not spending real money on gear . Repair bill will be close to 50 , 000 gold . The mob will drop about 3 , 000 gold in items and money . So then you get in a group and pray that the mob decides to chase another person . But there are tons more of them so you still die over and over . Sounds like fun huh ? Who thought mechanics that can one shot kill you were fun ? I also want to mention that the game lags like no other . Take the one shot mechanics from the aforementioned paragraph and sprinkle in some huge lag spikes and you can watch your characters die over and over to invisible mobs , invisible attacks , melee mobs hitting you clean across your screen , etc . And there is a Hardcore mode where if you die you lose your character and all of it ' s gear . That makes the game even more fun with lag ! Game is terrible . Leave it in the store . Do not buy . It is not fun in the slightest when you get to Inferno . The story is terrible . The gear drops don ' t exist for you . The auction house is the best place to level up . And the real money auction house has the best gear .

Disappointment\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: I ' m going to try and write this as a non - hardcore ( I think just above casual ) perspective for those who may be approaching it from that side . I ' ve only beat the game once on the default difficulty with a Barbarian and have since started all the other classes ( none of which have finished Act I yet ) . I remember ~ 15 years ago when Diablo II was kind of a big deal but some how I could never quite get into it . I played a few times in a group locally with friends and tried to play through solo a few times but some how it just never quite grabbed me . This I decided to see what the big deal was with Diablo so I just started up a barbarian , followed along with the story , read all the dialog and tried to take it all in . In total , trying to explore a lot and experimenting with different armor buffs and level - achieved perks , it took around 20 hours to kill Diablo ( my Barbarian at level 32 at the end ) . I did die a few times a long the way but nothing impossible . For at least one boss I just had to step back a moment , examine what was happening and re - adjust my approach . What I realized as I entered the final moments of the game was the default difficulty is actually an extended tutorial so you can learn your chosen character class and what style of combat works for you . In other words this game is made with the assumption it is going to played over and over and over again . Diablo III isn ' t made to be played through once and you ' re done . If that ' s the plan you ' re in for a disappointment as the default difficulty is incredibly easy and the story exists just enough to as a device to keep hacking and slashing away . Having only played through once I ' m sure the \" real \" players would say I haven ' t \" really \" played the game at all . But this review isn ' t for those players , it ' s for a Diablo - curious types . For what ' s worth my Barbarian approach was to stun the enemies around me and try to affect them with an area - of - effect shout and spin attack to kill multiple at once . I think I killed around twenty enemies in one shot that way once or twice . As I assume many reviewers have mentioned this game is online - only , even when you ' re solo . I have run into a few instances in which latency has really hit me ( I have cable connection around 25Mbps down ) . Seems like if blizzard wants to cripple the game that way they have they should at least have such issues resolved or at least some way of smoothly adapting to it . The servers go down every so often and unlike SC2 no offline play at all . I don ' t mind so much ( I just read a book ) . I have played multiplayer a few times and popping in and out is rather seamless . I haven ' t felt the need to play multiplayer so much because I am still learning the ins and outs of the game play and different classes . I do actually find it fun and interesting to experiment with different combinations of class skills and armor buffs / runes . And that ' s what the real game is : the endless quest for more , better loot . I have yet to be forced into the auction house so I can ' t speak to that . Personally I think I would just play my humble random drop builds in perpetuity before I ' d pay in - game - gold or real money for loot necessary to keep playing . But that ' s just me . I still don ' t know if I ' m going to get into the game enough to play over and over and over to get the \" bestest loot ever \" . Perhaps I ' ll just get all my characters ( with the various classes ) up to level 60 ( or as close to it as I can anyway ) so I have some cool characters to play with online with friends . Or perhaps I ' ll get tired of it before that and never touch or think about it again . It could go either way . Review from a non - hardcore\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: Sometimes when they make the next game in a series it doesn ' t resemble anything like the previous game in the series . Well with Diablo III you don ' t have to worry about it the game looks exactly like Diablo 2 in fact you could probably call this Diablo 2 . 1 . Eleven years after Diablo 2 comes out and they haven ' t made hardly any changes that you can you tell , I ' m not sure what they were thinking . Here are my observations of the game . First the biggest thing is to play single player you have to play online through Battle Net . This has to be the dumbest idea they could have come up with . I had problems getting my account setup since I hadn ' t played Battle Net in about 10 years so I didn ' t remember my password and the other information to reset it . It took several hours to get the download and get my account straightened out . I was fortunate and didn ' t have any problems getting into Battle Net once I had my account setup . I did have problems once I got on ; I got kicked out of Battle Net 3 times during the game . Once after a major Boss Fight and I lost all of the treasure , which really made me mad . There is a lot of server lag where you are in a fight and one second you are toe to toe fighting it out and the next you ' re on the other side of the screen , so disappointing . The game took me about 25 hours to complete with a level 31 Barbarian . The graphics and music are pretty much the same as Diablo 2 and you still have this far away camera angle and you can ' t zoom in to your character . I guess it really doesn ' t matter since you can ' t really customize your character you ' re stuck with one of five premade character classes all with a male or female option . You would think after 11 years you would be able to customize what your character looks like hair color and style and facial hair or not , nope they made them for you and sometime they are just ugly . You would think if you play with friends you could get confused on which is your character . Like I said there is nothing new in the game I did notice that they removed the matched armor sets that if you got the entire set it would give you a bonus . The game just got tedious after a while and I had to force myself to complete the game . In fact the only thing I really liked was the cut scenes the animation is just mind blowing they look so good . The game isn ' t bad but it ' s not good either and with having to play a solo game online does move it to bad game . The whole DRM thing is just stupid ; it ' s like putting a sophisticated alarm system on a Yugo . DIABLO II .

Could they have screwed this up any more ?\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: LOST IMMERSION and STYLE - This sequel marks the end of Diablo series as we knew it . Unfortunately , not for the better . The game is generic and boring . Mainly due to oversimplification of the aspects that made prior games so successful , including character customization ( skills and items ) and story . The game immersion experience is as result poor and feels more like a fast paced combat or arcade game than a Role Playing Game . GraphicsWhile updated and more subtle , graphics fail to offer visibility and immersion . This has been the struggle of game developers in the last decade or so to introduce the 3rd dimension , and too often , it was a failure . In Diablo III , you end having neither the visibility you had when in isometric 2d , or the immersion you would have in total 3d . Additionally , the graphics are too cartoonish , cute and polished to provide the feeling you would expect in a dungeon crawling scary game . Diablo I and II were far more scary and offered enough ` evidence ' for your imagination to trigger visions of horrors . In game cut scenes are an absolutely joke and seem to have been made for an arcade game from the 80 ' s ( only slightly exaggerating . . . . ) , anyway , not in line with the sprit of the prior games slow , terrifying , intense cut scenes . Cinematics are as usual of the highest quality . Music and soundMusic and sound effects are excellent , even if you will find some of the merit is low given most comes the original game . Character voice : are you kidding me ? Just listen to the female monk and you will stop there . GameplayThat is where the disappointment is the largest : hardly any customization of character : we all follow the same blend generic skill progression path . ImmersionNone whatsoever . I feel absolutely not committed to my character whose development seems to be just following a script . Similarly , the story seems to be a generic repeat of prior games . All ( items , quests ) seems to be delivered too fast for me to actually care of the objective or the outcome . The quests are delivered by an actor reading very fast the highlights of you will end up having to do . Yes , no more slowly unfolding mystery : you know pretty much all from the first moment . So complete lack of style from the art direction . ItemsThis used to be the single point of unquestionable force of the prior versions gameplay . You are now overwhelmed with low quality items that hardly change anything to the gameplay : Diablo I and II were item based RPGs . It would make or break your character . Now , you have the choice every minute to change your items from lower quality to low quality . Blizzard went exactly the wrong way : they added even more varieties of the useless items . Of course , you can be sure that you will ultimately find some great items , but this may require some extra real money using the auction house done for this very purpose . Server DependencySo , there will be instances you are not able to play the game . And when you are , you may see all action suddently stopped . That ' s right : you are not in control , Battle net is . The final flaw that seals it all . Conclusion : sadly have to recommend you go look for other games , especially for this type of money . By the way if you have not noticed , I was and still am a huge fan of both Diablo I and II .

For a game where you kill creatures and collect loot , you ' d expect that you could just pay sixty bucks and do so . Not so much , actually . The fact that this game is Online ONLY means that as longs as the servers are running well and turned on , you may play . But should the company decide to shut off access to the game for any reason , you have a worthless piece of software on your hands . To be brutally honest in single player this game is no better than Torchlight ( which retails for far less ) , and I strongly suspect that Torchlight ' s sequel ( to be released in 2012 , for a third of Diablo III ' s price tag ) will at least equal it ' s co - op with the addition of multiplayer action to that series . I cannot recommend buying this game ( which is honestly rare . . . I can only think of a handful of other titles in the past couple of decades that I felt this strongly about ) at this point . This is the largest failure of the single player portion of a game due to technical reasons ( note : not game design ones , I ' ve seen enough in the Beta which was playable to know that it ' s an average action - RPG , hack , slash , loot , that ' s what they ' re all about ) that I have ever seen . It rivals the worst of the multiplayer debacles I have witnessed as far as launches go , however . As a longtime fan of the series ( I played the betas and release versions of Diablo and Diablo II ) I can say that I am deeply disappointed . If you have 60 bucks and have already purchased a load of other games and really just can ' t find anything better to do and really absolutely MUST buy ? Drop the money . If not , don ' t bother . There ' s a lot more games out there that offer you better , more innovative gameplay and do not cripple you by forcing you to always be online . ( This review is being updated as the release continues . ) Day two shows improved uptime , but reinforces how glaringly poor a decision it was to rely upon an online - only model . Server performance is wildly variable . Playing in single player mode , a gamer can find themselves rubber - banding across the screen and unable to properly enjoy the experience . ( At this time I think that people engaging in Hardcore game play are quite simply insane . ) There may be a greater opportunity to play now than there was on the release date itself , but the fact of the matter is that the technical experience is greatly sub - par for the genre . This review remains a one - star as a result . ( continued again ) The end of day two on into the third day of release shows massive lag issues continuing randomly when starting new games . You can swap characters from being \" lag - free \" ( no more than moderate latency ) and end up hopping and skipping all over the screen as you move between the stash and the smith with the next character . A single player experience in a normal game in the genre is latency - free because it is handled locally . You don ' t happen to just die because the server hiccups . ( Like I said : if you ' re one of the people playing hardcore I ' m convinced you ' re a madman at this point . ) Even should this issue be resolved , there ' s still the persistent fact that if you are not connected to the net for any reason whatsoever ( and that does happen , as I have stated above ) you simply cannot play . This alone knocks points off the game , and as Blizzard has no intention of changing that , I see no reason why this review will ever rise above a three star . ( And at that point I ' ll be generously forgiving its mediocrity combined with its technical faux pas . . . ) Further gameplay has revealed more mediocre skills and a distinct lack of balance between classes . Some of them are an absolute breeze , never even being touched . Others are forced to get in , mix it up , and get slapped around . . go figure which one is which . . . unless this somehow miraculously changes deeper into the game I anticipate some of those achievements will be pretty difficult to unlock indeed . . . ( final update ) Day three . Continuing issues . Major latency problems . Client / server asset disputes . Random errors preventing connections . Disconnects still abound . ( Mind you we ' re seeing these issues NOT during prime time . . . so supposedly when the load would be lighter they STILL suffer from these problems . ) The game gets a three star rating from me , period . It lost a full star for the technical issues . ( Those issues will never go away . they are not launch issues . They are design decisions deeply ingrained in the way Blizzard has chosen to do things . I am not reacting to the bad launch . I am seeing where this will continue to be a problem forever . ) It gets a total of four stars excluding technical issues because it is decent and entertaining , but it is by no stretch a five star game . For that you need a lot more than Blizzard has given us with this title . My final say is this : if you really need a new Action RPG and cannot wait for something better , then go for it . I would suggest the following titles be purchased before this one , however : Torchlight , Borderlands ( plus all DLC / GotY edition ) , Titan Quest ( plus expansions ) and , if it ' s released by the time you read this review , Torchlight 2 . ALl of these cost less than D3 and are at least as good if not better games , and none of them have the technical issues that D3 has . Highly Touted , Hyped , and Oh Yeah : All - Too - Often Unplayable\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: It ' s hard to start talking about Diablo 3 because , as I see it - and I ' ve seen my opinion reflected on many other reviews - it has so many wrong things going on for it that it ' s kind of bewildering . I will try to express my disappointment and concern because I believe this game is a clear beacon as to to where video game developers are heading as of late , and a blatant case of how a company becomes so arrogant that it manages to neglect all inputs and feedback from its loyal fan base . So let ' s start with one of the biggest gripes people have had : the launch day fiasco . If it were any other developer in the world ( except maybe EA ) ; if they hadn ' t BETA - tested the game for many months and hadn ' t performed a public stress test two weeks prior to launch ; if they didn ' t have the experience with WoW and SC2 , it would be almost forgivable . But no , the had all the data , all the experience and all the means of supporting the launch for the game , and they miserably failed at it . And why wouldn ' t they fail at it ? In today ' s business of pre - orders we finance video game development and receive nothing back , and we don ' t even demand anything back from them . Blizzard had the obligation of giving a working piece of software for all of us that payed the price for it in advance , and they get away with a lame excuse in their website ? This is just so wrong , in so many levels . The gameplay was really dumbed - down and everyone is talking about it . The graphics , for me , aren ' t an issue , but the animations are ludicrously bad . Try watching the Demon Hunter fire two crossbows at once and you ' ll see what I mean bay BAD ANIMATION . Other aspects of the game that really stand out like a sore thumb : the quest screen is useless . Whereas in Diablo 2 you had a screen showing which quests you had completed , which was active and details on it , now you have a very vague description of your current task . If you want to see any piece of lore or any detail on your past exploits , you need to painfully navigate lots of sub menus . This has written \" rushed \" all over it . The very streamlined stats screen is also a joke , and if compared to the one from Diablo 2 it could easily be mistaken by a Diablo Lite version . And now , for my biggest gripe with the game . . . The story line , the characters and the whole universe of Diablo 3 . * * * Spoiler alert , don ' t continue reading if you haven ' t finished at least act 1 * * * In Diablo 2 we ' re greeted by this epic intro scene where we ' d be introduced to the Wanderer in this very creepy mausoleum . We ' d also witness what lied in his wake as an inn was engulfed in flames . And thus would begin our journey . Now we ' re introduced to Cain and his anime - inspired teen niece who had NEVER BEEN PRESENT IN THE OTHER GAMES . Now she magically appears and , as the intro goes on , we hear this annoying new narrator scream \" uncle \" just before the supposedly intimidating Diablo 3 logo is shown . It ' s such an anticlimax start . The story is so bad , so stupid that they managed to have Deckard Cain survive a meteor crash and escape the Skeleton King only to be killed at the end of Act 1 . The single most likable and recognized character in the series is thrown in the trash and replaced by this very annoying niece . Also , if the niece wasn ' t a dumb choice to begin with , she is given some sort of \" secret powers \" that conveniently manifest at key times in the narrative , showing not only a lack of creativity but a total deus ex machina gimmick . Diablo 3 deserves to be panned as it ' s been . It is the pinnacle of everything that is wrong with the video game development now a days : games being released with bugs , companies not measuring up to the ludicrous hype THEY create , not having to answer for the fact the game , which was already bought months earlier , does not run , simplified and dumbed - down gameplay , etc etc .

The best of the game ? the gold ' s auction house . It helps to improve your character . The worst of the game ? the real money auction house . It ' s a cash cow abomination . Not the Diablo 3 that many gamers were waiting but not too bad after all\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: - ABOUT MY FORMER LOVE OF BLIZZARD - I have bought the full version of every blizzard game ever made . I was one of the 1 , 000 beta testers of Diablo II . I bought the collectors version of world of warcraft and diablo 3 . I WAS a fan - boy . I think the activision / blizzard merger and sloughing off of their original team has obliterated the spirit of this company . # 1 COMPLAINT - IMPOSSIBLE & CHEAP DIFFICULTY - Diablo 3 has been a horrible disappointment for me . In hell mode , not even inferno mode , with max gear bought off the auction house , I die in 1 hit from normal mobs . I am a witch doctor . This game is supposed to be a hack and slash . Hack and slash should be somewhat laid back , even in harder difficulties , like Diablo II was . Granted it should have hard moments , but you shouldn ' t hit a brick wall every 2 minutes , that is if you can even get past the first brick wall . There are so many countless ways for mobs to kill you instantly . Instant death is around every corner . It makes the game a horribly painful experience . And the instant death is often quite cheap . For example a mob can pull you to them from across the screen and 1 hit you . A mob can die , and when they instantly explode on death which instantly kills you , which is especially horrible for melee classes . They can put up an impenetrable wall behind you , and a laser that rakes across you , killing you instantly . Some mobs run twice as fast as you and 1 - hit you . You cannot esc quit . There are no counters to these things . It doesn ' t matter what your skill level is , you will die , and die , and die . In multiplayer games , players simply drop out when there are mobs like these . You will not be able to do a play - through of an act in later difficulty with the same players because death is so frequent people simply give up . - HOPELESS HARDCORE MODE - In hardcore mode you will be lucky to make it past nightmare difficulty . I wouldn ' t even consider making a hardcore mode character . In Diablo II I had a couple level 90 + hardcore ' s . That was the main reason I was looking forward to Diablo III , all the fun I had in tense boss fights hoping I wouldn ' t die with my hardcore character , but if I did starting over was still fun . With Diablo III , you die so much it ' s pointless to even try . It ' s not fun at all , just 100 % guaranteed death and disappointment because you know your death will be based not on a miss - step , but on an undefeatable foe . - CHINESE BOT - FARM AUCTION HALL - Auto farming bots that farm gold 24 / 7 have already inflated auction hall prices into the millions of gold for a single item . A mob will drop around 100 gold in hell difficulty , and take maybe a minute to kill since it has to be kited so you don ' t get hit . So if you are a legit player , you are basically out of luck unless you are willing to pay American dollars for pretend gold from China . And blizzard gets a whopping 15 % cut . Blizzard succeeded in somehow making the problem of Chinese gold farmers even worse than it already was , and also succeeded in coming off as just another sleezy game company that doesn ' t care about game balancing or the spirit of fair competition . - CONCLUSION - This is not the laid back and enjoyable hack and slash that hardcore - hell - mode diablo II was , this is a real life nightmare that you can only wake up from by not playing the game . - AWESOME CINEMATICS - The cinematics are awesome , watch them online .

My WOW subscription was about to expire and I received an offer from Blizzard telling me that if I renew it for 1 year I will get Diablo 3 for free . Well , I wasn ' t thinking of renewing WOW since I ' ve played it for a while and I was about to quit . However , I was planning to buy D3 because I wanted a single player rpg game that I could take with me on road trips , vacation or in a flight . So , at that moment I thought well I will probably spend $ 60 on D3 anyways , what is a few more dollars for WOW do to me for another year subscription . I was wrong , had I know that this game required a constant online connection I would have not renewed my WOW subscription and spent over $ 70 + . After I downloaded and installed it I went to play and I was astonished that I needed to log on . At first I thought it was to validate my copy since I didn ' t purchase a physical copy of the game but NO , it was to play ! ! ! I felt cheated , wronged , and misled . I don ' t remember Blizzard ' s offer ever telling me that this game required an online connection . Your classic bait and switch , I can probably see a class suit over this issue . Besides , I don ' t see any real benefit to this online connection , no PVP , no guilds , no raids , etc . . . I can see myself playing this game for about 1 - 2 months to beat it since I have a small child and I can only play 1 hour or 2 a few days a week but above all I see no replay value and no portability . I also ran into the gear deficiency issue in Act I , Yes , Act I people ! ! ! I didn ' t bother buying anything in the AH while I was playing this act so once I got to the final boss , I couldn ' t beat him with the crappy gear I had collected from drops so , I had to go to the AH and spend a few hours looking for items in order to beat him ( buyout only auctions , I didn ' t feel like bidding and waiting 1 day to play this supposedly single player game ) . Now , here lies a potential problem , I can only imagine this gear problem getting worse over the remaining acts and in the higher difficulty settings . Thus , my biggest concern is that I don ' t plan to spend real money on the real money auction house ( RMAH ) but I can see once the RMAH issue is up and running all the decent gear will go there and make the VMAH useless . In other words , if you were seeking a single player game that you could take with you on the go such as a road trip , family visit , library , etc . . . , look for another game and save your hard earned money .

But I ' ll give my review none - the - less in the hopes somebody finds something fresh in it . So here is my list of 10 things that matter to me with Diablo III : 1 . ) I bought the game and had no problem logging in , nor playing at will . A lot of the poor early reviews should be revised on this alone . It appears that the early server issues have been resolved and there have been two game patches to date to fix some other random issues . My experience ( just from a game running standpoint ) is that the game runs fine on my slightly older middle of the road machine and a decent cable connection . 2 . ) This whole DRM thing doesn ' t bother me a bit . I think it is a little funny people are up in arms over this . However , they ' ll shoot pictures of themselves all day long on camera phones and text them , Tweet their daily lives to strangers , or post the same Tweets and pictures to Facebook for the whole world to see . If they only knew who had access to that data , worrying about being online to play a game would seem trivial . 3 . ) Upon starting the game , the characters seem a little cartoonist in graphical style . Not my gig , but after a few hours of play , didn ' t really detract from the game . The one big drawback for me is that you once again can ' t change the camera angle or game play from being over top of the character . No zoom or first person perspective the way you can in Skyrim , for example . I think for a \" new \" game 6 years in development that they missed the boat here . 4 . ) Graphics are decent , but not stellar considering it is 2012 . The good is that on a older machine you can play on high settings and it looks very good . The bad is that on newer machines you don ' t get near the graphical detail you ' d be expecting from a game surrounded by this much hype . Nobody wants to buy a new high end gaming rig to play Diablo III , but it is hardly making my machine sweat . Again , considering other offerings like Skyrim , this game seems oddly dated already considering both cost $ 60 and one delivers and one doesn ' t . 5 . ) The story is pretty boring . Nothing new . Nothing exciting . Same old plug the hole in the earth from the evil that is trying to invade it kind of grind . I guess all these years later it is getting harder for D & D ; stories to vary much but I ' d sure like to see someone try a novel approach . 6 . ) Voice acting is abysmal . The old wizard at the start of the game sounds like they drug him out of the guard house to their corporate headquarters . The voice work alone almost ruins the game for me as each time there is dialogue I cringe . Blizzard must have just picked in house random people as that is the level of talent you get . Also , the game sound is nothing spectacular . Your high end audio cards won ' t be needed as surround sound doesn ' t appear to even be supported . If it is , I can ' t tell it is so crappy . 7 . ) On normal difficulty , the game is hardly challenging . As a Wizard , I just waded into a group of enemies , waited for them to surround me , froze them , and then start bombing away with spells watching them explode all around me . It gets quite repetitive and I found myself using the same attacks over and over without the need to change spells , etc . It would have been nice to need to strategically plan encounters . Okay , this enemy hates fire , or that one hates cold . Instead , I just bombed away with the same three spells killing everything . Also , not being able to set the difficulty level at the start really detracts from the game to me . As a hardcore gamer it just seems like a no brain - er in today ' s world . Let us pick . If the game is too hard , we can always select an easier mode . Blizzard making us play to unlock harder levels just sucks and is hardly exciting . 8 . ) I have not used the auction house , nor have I found a reason to at this point . I have found everything I need , or have bought if from merchants . I have not hit a road bump yet that made me think , maybe I need to go there to find better armor or weapons to get past this part of the game . Same thing with crafting items . It seems like it was almost an afterthought . Considering what you find in the game , and what you can buy from merchants , and what you could buy at the auction house , it sort seems like a waste of energy to try and make objects . Not only that , but the magical properties of many of your items are randomly generated so you don ' t even know if your time and effort will create something your character really benefits from . 9 . ) Character classes are essentially the same . No real outside the box thinking here other than the witch doctor . Again , not much exciting and new in your character development . 10 . ) Worth maybe $ 29 . 99 but no way is this game worth $ 60 . So there you have it . I really want to love the game but just can ' t seem to find enough in it to get me over the hump . To me , Diablo III is a middle of the road game that will produce multiple hours of decent enjoyment and nothing more . Not horrible , but not great either . That being said , it is hardly worth the $ 60 price of entry at this point . Wait for it to come down to $ 30 or less and you ' ll have an excuse to play it without feeling like you just got wrecked by the Butcher .

I have encountered numerous people voicing similar complaints . Their are also many , many people who have had hacked accounts so early into the release of this game . It is scary to think of the large scale this is happening at already . Blizzard as well as their fanboys and undercover employees place absolute blame on the individuals who had the hacked account . The game is very short in general . If you are of moderate ability as far as gaming goes you can expect to finish the story within 7 hours at most . After that it ' s all repeat on higher difficulty . The story is poorly composed , and the gameplay is clearly targeting people of low ability as far as gaming go . Like many people say , this is a $ 40 game with a $ 60 price tag . That 40 is only if everything worked , which it doesnt . Even when they get everything working I would suggest against making the transition onto Diablo ' s poorly made world . Their are an ample supply of alternative games to choose from . You should pursue anything else . The Lord of Terror should have returned on April Fool ' s\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: What can I say , while I made it through the game , there is nothing to draw me back .

OK game .\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: I ' ve been a Blizzard fan ever since the days of Warcraft 2 . Few companies have delivered quality games with such consistency as Blizzard has . Sadly , that trend of quality seems to have waned in recent years , particularly since Blizzard ' s merger with Activision in 2008 . The focus shifted away from delivering the highest possible quality of product , and toward milking as much money as possible out of these games . It began with World of Warcraft , and the overhauls in the game intended to add as many paying subscribers as possible , while leaving the longtime players hanging out to dry . Then it became the sale of in - game vanity items for real cash , in a game that already charges $ 40 for an expansion every 2 years on top of the existing $ 15 monthly fee . In Starcraft 2 , there was surprisingly very little milking of the product on the surface . This is likely due to the fact that this is the eSports poster child for Blizzard , and there ' s just not that much to sell cosmetically in a RTS . However , they did plan for 2 expansions right off of the bat , and there is talk of selling custom maps for real money in the future . But for the most part , Starcraft 2 is actually a quality title , and one that I will continue to play and enjoy . Sadly , the same amount of time and effort put into Starcraft 2 was not made here . Diablo 3 , while pretty , is not a very deep or complex game . It is mostly a spammable clickfest , where you occasionally get a shiny item that may or may not be useful to you . Strategy is limited to \" stay out of the glowing stuff , click the bad guy until he falls over \" . You beat the game in about 6 hours , at which point you ' re invited to play the exact same game through a second time , and then a third time , and then a fourth time . That ' s the extent of replayability in this game . Play the exact same 6 hour stretch of content over and over and over again , just hoping that the right shiny thing drops for you . One addition of controversy in this game is the \" Real Money Auction House \" , where players are able to buy and sell the shiny things they find in the game for actual money . Blizzard claims this is to reduce illegitimate items sales and gold farming , in reality , it ' s just another money grab for them . If you want to know why , look no further than the selling fees . You lose 15 % any time you sell and item , and you lose another 15 % every time you try to actually to redeem the money that you ' ve earned . You lose a whopping 30 % on the sale of a digital item . That ' s absolute insanity , and the result is that it drives up prices , making the illegitimate \" black market \" sellers all the more appealing . And of course , there ' s the issue of servers . You ' re forced to play on Blizzard ' s servers , which have had an embarrassingly high amount of downtime thus far . Clearly Blizzard wasn ' t prepared for this . Needless to say , I ' ve found myself rather bored of this game already . There ' s very little incentive to continue playing it aside from the chance to try and make some money on the auction house . There ' s not any significant content on the horizon other than the PvP patch ( which will get old very quickly ) , there ' s no custom user - created content like Starcraft 2 has either ( which isn ' t necessary under normal circumstances , but when there ' s this little content to the game , it absolutely is necessary ) . I will consider my lesson learned for this game , and will eagerly be looking forward to the release of Guild Wars 2 instead . For those lifetime Blizzard fans like me that are still clinging onto hope , know that the Blizzard you once loved is all but dead now . Move on . The slow decline of Blizzard continues\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: I have never been soooooo disappointed in all my gaming days as I have been with this launch and gameplay of Diablo 3 . I really thought it was going to be great and better than Diablo 2 but it ' s not . It ' s dumbed down in the worst ways with no more customization of STATS & SKILLS . Do they not understand we want MORE ability to create out own custom characters ? You are also led down a linear rope from one place to another . Where ' s the OPEN PLAY of Diablo 2 ?

I ' m just going to point out my secondary reasons for disliking it : I am a story - oriented player ( I loved Skyrim for instance ) and D3 has little to no real plot . The single - player game is really just there to get you up to speed so you can PVP online vaguely similar to League of Legends . If you like that sort of game you will still not like D3 due to the bugs and connection issues , but when ( presumably later in 2012 ) they get their house in order , the game should be enjoyable for you . For me , D3 fails on all levels : not story - driven , and bugs and connection - issues are so frequent that it reduces the fun in single - player mode , leading to frustration .

I ' d skip this one\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: I had some dental surgery last week , so I needed to kill some time at home . Unfortunately , I had played a lot of other games so there was nothing to really try but Diablo 3 . I had heard a lot of tall tales going around about people making big money off the RMAH ( real money auction house ) so I figured why not give it a try . After a week of playing and getting to Inferno act 2 . . . I can safely say this is one of the weirdest products foisted on the gaming community that I ' ve ever seen . I say product , because D3 is more product than game . You surely know how casinos glitz up their slots and their decor to create constant stimulation . . . Well , Diablo 3 is more like a casino than a videogame . The spell effects are big and over the top , the graphics dramatic and colorful . There ' s stimulation constantly . However there ' s no game . Strategy - wise you don ' t really do anything . Either you have the appropriate gear and items to fight or you ' ve run up against a wall and need to buy something extra in the auction house . This can be done with gold you earn playing the game . . . BUT . . . not when it matters . The final run of the game is called Inferno . At this point you ' ll need millions of gold per gear piece by Act 2 or simply die in the game . And remember , as I said there ' s no strategy either way . Either you ' ve bought enough gear , or you die . They were even thoughtful enough to add huge fees for dying in Inferno , to truly lock you in to using the auction house . Now to make matters even worse for the poor soul playing the game normally , they added a real money auction house . Using this brilliant feature you can buy items for up to $ 250 to help you beat a game you already beat 3 times . Make sense ? It shouldn ' t . The \" money for nothing \" greed surrounding this is reminiscent of the web craze called bitcoins . To clarify , everyone loses here except for the house and the early adopters . Because I started the game last week , I doubt I ' ll ever make more than a few dollars here and there on the auction house versus the thousands some have already made . And as the pyramid scheme gets less and less believable by the people willing to hold up the bottom , the whole thing will be utterly worthless . In short , the game currently resembles a money making scheme of the shadiest type more than a game . It really makes me wonder what Blizzard is doing in the gaming business . I mean they are casino developers . That ' s a fact , they just do it in the virtual space . As game developers they lack any concern whatsoever for the elements of the RPG experience . The storytelling is Saturday morning quality , which is being generous . Cartoons usually have themes and some plot development . This game does not ; it just has the silly voice acting of cartoons . This game lacks any attention to gameplay details . It ' s impossible to think of any fresh tactics to try playing this game , because you can ' t do any with the controls and design of it . You can whack away at the monster . You can use one of the few build selections that work at level 60 . That ' s it , the rest is 99 . 9 % stats . Anyone who says all ARPG or dungeon crawlers are this simple is crazy . It ' s the norm for there to be layers of options to your play choices in any game . This game doesn ' t have any layers because they want you to focus on buying the items and that ' s it . So there you go . You have been warned , and probably chastised by many for even thinking about buying this game . But the choice is yours . If you do get it though , give some love to developers of games that care . Check out Guild Wars 2 or some indie games . You can ' t go wrong playing those thoughtfully developed games . The graphics are nice . Then you realize the game is a scam .\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: I ' ll start out saying I didn ' t like D1 or D2 , but enjoy dungeon crawlers such as Dungeon Siege / NWN / Torchlight / Borderlands . So I was reluctant to purchase D3 , and wanted to wait till it was $ 29 bucks or something . Got it anyways on a gift card FTW . The bad : * D3 has to have the worst story line I ' ve ever suffered through . While the voice acting is \" ok \" , what ' s being said is so utterly stupid . It ' s almost like watching some B movie that ' s trying to be serious . I wanted to like this story line . It ' s impossible . Listening to it three times already all I want is some setting that allows me to turn it off . * Always online . Now I ' ve played D3 I understand . Blizzard is greedy and some folks are actually stupid enough to use real money to win this game . Awesome . Thanks for the lag you created designing the game around this greed . * The game is tailored to make you spend gold / money at the AH . At level 40 , the gear dropping for you is 30ish . Anything that drops for you is trash loot compared to what you ' ll buy in the AH for 1000 g . * Loot drops . Why does a wooden stump give me an upgrade when those three elite mobs I fought for 5 minutes dropped trash loot ? * Zone size . You can walk around any \" zone \" in less than 5 minutes once cleared . That means it ' s smaller than my neighborhood . One day maybe we ' ll play a Blizzard game that doesn ' t feel claustrophobic . Highly doubtful - they spend all dev time working on RMAH stuff . * Crafting - Why does a boar drop better gear than I can craft ? Does Blizzard ever get tired of boars ? I ' m really & * # & % $ tired of seeing armored boars in Blizzard games . What do these boars eat to become powerful enough to drop yellow loot ? The good : * It ' s mindless fun . I can ' t stress \" mindless \" enough . There ' s no thinking involved , just click and dodge . Don ' t spend more than 10 seconds analyzing gear , just vendor it and go to the gold AH . Conclusion : Buy it if you like mindless grinds , but don ' t take D3 seriously and certainly don ' t torture yourself with money generating Inferno mode . It ' s maybe a little better than Torchlight 1 , but I don ' t think it ' s a good as Titan Quest . Play the game till it ' s no longer fun , then play something else .

Maybe I ' m a bit cynical , but I kind of saw all of this coming , from the first point hearing about the healing orbs ( aka power ups ) to the DRM fiasco . Most if not all the original makers of the Diablo franchise left Blizzard years ago for other companies ( Torchlight / Torchlight 2 ) , leaving a crew that ' s basically made WoW . Unfortunately for them , that ship , WoW , has pretty much run its course . With regards to D3 , the criticism is not really a case of \" this isn ' t Diablo [ II ] enough \" but rather , this is all the bad sides of D2 , with none of the good aspects ( namely character customization and sort of a sandboxey go - where you like when you like feeling . D3 100 % linear guided tour , no choices , game on rails . ) . Take D2 . You had to grind through 2 difficulties before you got to the \" real \" difficulty level where all the good stuff dropped and the tough battles ensued . Doing those quests for a the millionth time really sucked but hey , that ' s what you had to do . And you decided which quests you wanted to do , and sometimes in what order , and could go pretty much wherever you wanted whenever you wanted as long as you killed the act bosses . Only this time , in D3 , you have to grind through 3 difficulties before you get to the final one . At least this time they shortened the time it takes , but in a way that ' s a negative as well just because there is hardly 60 bucks worth of content . In D2 the loot made things interesting , but in D3 the loot is super randomized and always improving but doesn ' t feel special . Think about it . . . would you rather play 60 hours of content on one difficulty level , or play 15 hours of content , four times repeated ? The second option sounds boring , and maybe in my misspent youth I would have gone for it , but now I think gamers know better . Skyrim is looking like A LOT better value right now and at least is a real role - playing game . A roleplaying game is one where you take a risk , you invest in certain skills and skip others , and your character is a unique creation ; you might have picked a good combo , or maybe not , but it was still your choice , your experiment . In Diablo III , it ' s a socialist dystopia where everyone is perfectly equal and perfectly the same and perfectly boring . If you want a character progression and choice over your path , don ' t just walk , run away from this title . Diablo III is a game inspired by RPGs , even the interface and town interiors look ripped from Baldur ' s Gate . But the game itself really has more in common with Contra or Metal Slug , 2d shooter style games where you run around , shoot the baddies , get the power - up , etc etc . The rune system later in the game makes this a little more complex , but is sorta like Contra where you earned different ways of shooting - everyone has access to the exact same runes ( skill tweaks ) at any time , and you can change them at the drop of a hat . Nothing ventured , nothing gained . Diablo III looks like a mishmash of Warcraft III , World of Warcraft , and Diablo . It can ' t quite decide whether it wants to be scary or cute and colorful , so it does both . The monsters and scorched ground areas look ripped from the undead campaigns in Warcraft III . Honestly , if someone had told me this was some sort of super mod for that game , I might have believed them , as the game looks more like I ' d expect a Warcraft game than Diablo . The Grotesque monsters , for example , are supposed to be nasty things that scratch and claw and then blow themselves up into a bloody mess . But instead they look like Kirby from the Nintendo games or mini versions of the Stay Puffed Marshmellow Man from Ghostbusters . Seriously , the monsters are for the most part just WoWish and don ' t look like they belong in a traditional fantasy universe ( like Dungeons and Dragons ) . In the end , I can ' t believe it took them so long to develop what is essentially maybe 15 - 20 hours of content , strung along through repeated difficulties . I ' m sure someone will play this for hundreds of hours trying to get a marginally different styled armor for their cookie cutter character ( since now there are really only as many character builds as there are character types ) . You can take Blizzard ' s side and say that \" streamlining \" the game was good , but in reality , every character is exactly the same looking and acting , minus whatever differences in gear happen . All female wizards for example look EXACTLY alike and have no customization of skills , appearance , face , hair , etc . , etc , and if you ' ve seen one , you ' ve seen them all . This was acceptable in 2000 , not in 2005 and certainly not now . Neverwinter Nights , Guild Wars , and Elder Scrolls games all always offered more depth of who your character was . No replayability . I guess we can face it that this is an action game with customizable armor , but where apparently the physical damage of a held weapon determines your ability to shoot fire and lighting from your palms . I ' m sure someone will say that makes choosing a weapon easier , but it just makes the game make no sense , unless you look at it from the perspective of the developers not having the time or creativity to actually develop a convincing attack bonus system for casters . In a way , the makers are lucky that people are locked out of the game . Everyone wanted more from D3 than they remembered from D2 , and I think most people got much less than they were hoping for . Bad voice acting , bad storyline , and neat but ultimately forgettable cinematics ( probably the cause of all the delay - - Blizzard having to pay for and film the equivalent of a movie within a game ) . A game that can ' t really decide if it ' s a single player game or an MMO , so it tries to do both and doesn ' t truly suceed . This is MMO - light , probably for people who sadly don ' t have the experience to know what this game is missing . If this wasn ' t rentware , I ' d give it 2 stars for at least having town interiors that reminded me of classic Bioware games . I haven ' t said much about the DRM and heavy server lag because everyone already knows the game is going to be somewhat crippled for a little while longer until either more people quit or Blizzard improves capacity . I think it will be a fun game a year or two from now when it is patched and everything is rethought and the price is cut . It is simply unplayable ( lag , disconnects , 40 minutes of lost progress ) at random times , and that ' s why my review is 1 star instead of 2 stars . Until then , save your money , and buy something else . D3 just isn ' t in the same league as the other games mentioned , and it just isn ' t worth paying that much for a temporary game that will be unplayable the day Blizzard decides to pull the plug on their servers , which could be tomorrow or could be 10 years from now ( the mighty can fall - just look at the banks and GM ) . In the end , you aren ' t paying for a game , you ' re paying for a subscription to their ( laggy ) servers , a MMORPG without the RPG and without the MM . Games which are IMO bettersome NWN games ( NWN2 Mask of the Betrayer comes to mind , as do the expansions for the first NWN ) Baldur ' s Gate series ( and anything else made by Bioware with the infinity engine , including Planescape Torment and Icewind Dale ) Dragon Age OriginsGuild Wars seriesElder Scrolls seriesTorchlight seriesSaw this coming a mile away\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: This game would be totally worth the purchase as a $ 20 steam title but as a full priced AAA title it falls flat on its face .

First , you have to fill out a little form ( normal ) , then you have to do these 2 diagnostic things on your computer that they have instructions for , you have to save thew files to your desktop and attach the file on the form , I do all that and click next . . . SERVER DOWN TRY AGAIN LATER ! ! I bought this game , I have the box for both game and expansion and it is pathetic I have to go through this just to play a game by myself on the computer , and it is a shame that I will not even be able to play when I go to the lake home . The game is pretty good but the hassle and internet requirement make it impossible to give this game more than 3 stars even though the first 2 Diablo games were absolute masterpieces and I have been anticipating this game for like . . . 10 years ! Game is good but Blizzard should be ashamed of this set up !\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: I had fun playing Diablo 3 for awhile but there ' s little reason to replay it again . The first play - through was alright until you realize how repetitive it was . There ' s also a problem with the difficulty scaling I think . On the first play - through the game was almost too easy and then on the next difficulty the game is way too hard . I think part of that has to do with how terrible the loot is . 95 % of the loot you find is worse than the same equipment you found ages ago and 99 % of the loot is for a different class then you ' re playing . I beat Diablo 3 Inferno difficulty and the loot I got after the Diablo boss fight was a joke . I think there was one item for my current class and it ' s stats were way under what I already had from the beginning of the game . If you can pick up Diablo 3 for cheap I ' d buy it but there ' s no reason to pay $ 60 for it . I can see why so many people are disappointed with Diablo 3 after playing it myself . Fun for a little bit and that ' s it .\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: The game is extremely fun the first playthrough ( probably 30 hours if you ' re actually watching the movies , etc . ) . The action is fast paced , the skill systems are simplistic in design and interface , but yet very complex since each character has nearly endless possible skill combinations . The game has four difficulties each with increasingly better loot to keep you interested . Normal difficulty is as it should be - not so easy that it ' s boring , but not so hard that anyone is likely to get stuck . Nightmare difficulty is tough , but with persistence and a little bit of thought you ' ll make it through . Hell is Hell , and inferno will be only for the most dedicated and serious players - the top 1 % , if that . The average user is going to start to get stuck around late nightmare / early hell difficulty , and either quit in frustration and give the game a 1 star rating or keep running through dungeons trying to get more gold for that next piece of armor or awesome weapon , to get a bit deeper into the game . So you have a 30 hour plot basically , but replayability is potentially very high . I like online only !\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: Diablo 3 is a fun game , but good luck playing it .

However this watered down garbage is not worth anyone ' s time let alone the obscene 60 $ price tag . The story is basically a badly framed ' last time on Diablo ' recap that fails to engage the player or attempts to actually break new ground . Literally the story is tacked on it feels like an afterthought . The randomly generated dungeons are absent ( short of the possibility to launch ' events ' which are short random fights ) leaving you to slog through the exact same content over and over again . This title really feels half assed . I don ' t know what has been going on the past few years at Bliz but they really have lost their edge . Bottom line , Boring game dont bother . Bland .\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: I literally have no idea where to start . I am still at such a loss for words for this game , that I am shocked it even exists . I am putting this in 2 parts . The first stage of my disappointment , and the second . First . 1 : The pre - buy crowd that I was in got treated to a lovely heaping pile of incomplete garbage on release day . 2 : The game itself is nothing like it ' s hit predecessors . Skill trees ? No , you just get access to more skills over time . . . No skill points , no decisions . Just tick a box and go to town . 3 : Zero . Support . Ever . 4 : In the first week of release , I had more downtime and lost time due to serverside issues , than actual play time . Bad . So all of these things made me sad , and I uninstalled and Shelved D - 3 till now . . . The winter of my discontent . Second . So I installed it again . What do I get ? Frequent and unreconcilable Hard Crashes . It literally locks my computer up , and my forces restart after about 10 - 13 minutes of play . Consistently and reliably . For reference , I run an Asus G73sw , Win 7 64 bit . It runs every other title in my library flawlessly , including : Farcry 3GTA 4Skyrim ( heavily modded to boot ) XCOM : Enemy UnkownHomefrontS . T . A . L . K . E . R . SeriesSaint ' s Row 4Sid Meier ' s Civilization 5So . Not my computer . It is an interaction between D - 3 and my comp . I am so disappointed in Blizzard , that I ' m not even disappointed anymore . . . Except in myself . Biggest Disappointment Since Starcraft 2 .\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: This game really suffers due to Activision / Blizzards interest in massive profits from this sequel three years in the making . I ' ve played for ~ 50 hours or so across three characters ( level 52 Barbarian , level 35 Wizard and level 29 Demon Hunter ) and the higher the level of the character , the less likely it is you ' ll get a drop that is an upgrade for your character . This is on purpose as Activision / Blizzard ' s goal is to drive people to their real money auction house so they can progress in the game . Now I ' m expected to either pay additional $ $ $ for this $ 60 game to allow my character ' s progress , or simply quit playing . This is not an improvement over Diablo II , it ' s an obvious money - grab and Blizzard should be ashamed . I expect this type of thing from Activision , but not Blizzard . This game is broken after Nightmare mode\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: Its got to the point now that pc singleplayer games are a joke . All because of the lousy pirates . Now we have to be logged in online to play . And what do we get for this . . We get nothing but laggy singleplayer games . I really wanted to like this game but if you can ' t play because of lag how can you . It was tough to get through this game but i did . And i refuse to play it on a harder mode till they fix the dam lag . What kills me is i ' m a wow player and run the game at max settings and never have lag . My pc is a powerhouse quad core system . I got killed so many times in this game because of the lag . And whats worse is i heard the online play of the game runs smoother . That is like a bad joke . I would wait on buying this game until Blizzard fixes the servers . Lag in singleplayer game .\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: This game is an absolute failure . The game is still currently , \" unless I have time to play 8 hours a day or buy a bot ( automated program that plays the game for you ) , I have to pay real money to buy items from people who do play 8 hours a day or use bots all day . \" The game is still 0 fun . They ' ve added absolutely nothing new . The way this game is right now , should be what a game looks like in the alpha . Item design is still terrible . Random stats on all items in the game ? Two handed swords that only give intelligence ? It looks like they hired a 2nd year undergraduate computer programming student , had him write a simple program , and used that program to implement items in this game . Shame on Activision . Funny how everything they buy seems to turn into a ruined , money - grabbing product . November 6 , 2012 - STILL TRASH\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: Diablo III is not a game . It is merely an access kit to a game , which is stored somewhere on Blizzard ' s server farms . To play the game , you must have and maintain a highspeed internet connection . Everything in \" your game \" - - your data , your gear , your characters - - is actually Blizzard ' s , parked on one of their servers . While the rationale for doing this varies and includes everything from stopping piracy to blocking mods / hacking and making money off the \" auction house \" , the outcome is the same : you don ' t own this game or even any substantial part of it . All you own is a key that lets you in to visit the game , so long as Blizzard feels like keeping its servers up and maintaining \" your \" characters and data during your prescribed visiting hours . As many have already discovered , they don ' t feel like doing that particularly well . This situation has been a long time coming . Years ago , in what is now obviously a faded golden age of gaming , you actually owned the game you bought . Subject to at most perhaps an annoying CD security key , you still at least had a physical object that you could carry around and load into other physical objects whenever you felt like , enjoying the game for as many years as you want and anywhere you want without requiring pre - approval from the company ' s massive cloud computing Death Star . Somehow , us gamers let that time get away from us . Starcraft II was the most recent warning , when people discovered that much of the functionality of Starcraft had actually disappeared and live internet was required even for single player campaigns ( which also were initially missing 2 of the 3 playable races included in Starcraft 1 by default ) . People got upset , but not upset enough to make a difference . Perhaps things have changed now . The simple fact is that we are going backwards in game design even as technology improves . Diablo III is a pathetic shell compared to Diablo II . Like a divorced parent , you have to count the moments until you can visit your characters for a little while , and then get kicked back out the door the moment your visitation window ends . Whether the series will continue to devolve into nothing more than a series of lame DLCs hidden on Blizzard servers and locked by $ 60 - 100 paygates depends as much on us as it does on them . $ 60 access kit\n","The results of aspect term extraction have been saved in /content/atepc_inference.result.json\n","Example 0: Huge Diablo fan . . . completely let down .
